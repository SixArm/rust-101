# Panic and how to handle it with a hook

In Rust, a `panic` occurs when a program encounters a situation where it cannot continue to run safely. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a failed assertion, an out-of-bounds array access, or an attempt to unwrap a `None` value. When a `panic` occurs, Rust will unwind the stack and search for a `catch_unwind` block that can handle the panic. If no such block is found, the program will terminate with an error message.

By default, Rust will print an error message and terminate the program when a panic occurs. However, it is possible to customize this behavior by adding a `panic` hook. This allows you to define your own `panic` handler that can log the error, send an alert, or perform other actions before terminating the program.

You can define a `panic` hook by calling the `std::panic::set_hook` function and passing a closure that takes a `PanicInfo` struct as an argument. This struct contains information about the panic, such as the file and line where it occurred and the message associated with the panic.

Here is an example of a simple panic hook that logs the panic message and terminates the program:

```rust
use std::panic;

fn main() {
    panic::set_hook(Box::new(|panic_info| {
        let message = panic_info
            .payload()
            .downcast_ref::<String>()
            .unwrap_or(&"Unknown error".to_string());
        eprintln!("Panic occurred: {}", message);
    }));

    // Trigger a panic
    panic!("Something went wrong!");
}
```

This sets a `panic` hook that logs the `panic` message to the standard error stream using the `eprintln` macro. When the program encounters a `panic!` macro, it will trigger the panic hook and log the error message before terminating the program.

In general, it is best to avoid panics when possible and handle errors gracefully using Rust's `Result` type. However, in some cases, panics may be the appropriate way to handle errors that cannot be recovered from.
