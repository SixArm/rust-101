# Rust mdBook for documentation

Rust mdBook is a tool for creating and publishing documentation in the form of books or websites. It is specifically designed for documenting Rust projects, but it can be used for any kind of documentation.

At its core, Rust mdBook is a Markdown compiler that can generate HTML, PDF, and eBook formats. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted text using a simple syntax. This makes it easy to create readable and organized documentation without having to learn complex formatting rules.

Rust mdBook also includes a number of features that make it easy to create professional-looking documentation. It supports syntax highlighting for code blocks, table of contents generation, cross-referencing between pages, and customizable themes.

One of the key benefits of Rust mdBook is its integration with the Rust ecosystem. It includes support for documenting Rust code using Rustdoc comments, which can be automatically generated from the codebase. This makes it easy to keep documentation up-to-date and in sync with the code.

To use Rust mdBook, you create a book directory that contains the Markdown files and any associated assets, such as images or code samples. You can then use the mdBook command-line tool to compile the book into the desired format. The resulting output can be published as a website or distributed as an eBook or PDF.

Overall, Rust mdBook is a powerful and flexible tool for creating and publishing documentation, particularly for Rust projects. Its support for Markdown, code highlighting, and cross-referencing make it easy to create high-quality documentation that is easy to read and understand.
