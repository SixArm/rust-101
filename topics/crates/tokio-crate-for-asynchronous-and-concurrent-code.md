# Tokio crate for asynchronous and concurrent code

<https://crates.io/crates/tokio>

The Rust Tokio crate is a widely used library for building asynchronous and concurrent applications. It provides a runtime for executing asynchronous tasks and a set of libraries for building networking and other I/O-heavy applications.

First add it to your project's dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Once you've added Tokio to your project, you can start using it to build asynchronous and concurrent applications. For example, you can define a Tokio task that performs an asynchronous computation:

```rust
use tokio::task;

async fn compute() -> u32 {
    // Perform an expensive computation asynchronously
    42
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let result = task::spawn(compute()).await.unwrap();
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

This defines an `async` function called compute that performs an expensive computation asynchronously and returns a `u32`. The `#[tokio::main]` attribute tells Tokio to use its runtime to execute the main function, and the `task::spawn` function spawns a new task to execute the compute function asynchronously.

In summary, the Tokio crate is a powerful library for building asynchronous and concurrent applications in Rust. It provides a runtime for executing asynchronous tasks and a set of libraries for building networking and other I/O-heavy applications. Its documentation provides a detailed guide on how to use it for different use cases and scenarios.


## Tokio for network applications

You can also use Tokio to build network applications, such as a simple HTTP server:

```rust
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use tokio::net::TcpListener;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];
            let n = socket.read(&mut buf).await.unwrap();
            let request = String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf[..n]);
            println!("Received request:\n{}", request);

            let response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, World!";
            socket.write_all(response.as_bytes()).await.unwrap();
        });
    }
}
```

This defines a main function that binds to port 8080 and listens for incoming TCP connections. When a connection is accepted, a new task is spawned to handle the request asynchronously. The task reads the incoming data from the socket, prints it to the console, and sends a response back to the client.
