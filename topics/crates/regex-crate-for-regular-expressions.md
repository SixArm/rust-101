# regex crate for regular expressions

The Rust regex crate is a regular expression library for the Rust programming language. It provides a fast and efficient way to search, match, and manipulate text using regular expressions.

The regex crate is based on the popular PCRE library, which is widely used in many programming languages for regular expression support. However, the Rust regex crate is designed specifically for Rust and provides a native Rust API that is both safe and easy to use.

The main types provided by the regex crate are the `Regex` and `Captures` types. The `Regex` type represents a compiled regular expression pattern that can be used to search for matches in a text string. The `Captures` type represents the groups captured by a successful match and allows for easy extraction of matched substrings.

The regex crate supports a wide range of regular expression syntax, including Perl-style regular expressions and POSIX extended regular expressions. It also supports Unicode character properties and provides a range of Unicode-aware matchers and modifiers.

The regex crate is highly performant and is designed to handle large inputs efficiently. It provides a range of options for controlling the matching behavior, such as case-insensitive matching, multi-line matching, and greedy or lazy quantifiers.

Overall, the Rust regex crate is a powerful and flexible regular expression library that provides a fast and efficient way to search, match, and manipulate text in Rust programs. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including text processing, data validation, and parsing.
