# Who are Rust leaders?

Rust is a community-driven programming language, so it does not have any official leaders in the traditional sense. However, there are several key individuals and organizations that have contributed significantly to Rust's development and have played a prominent role in shaping the language and its ecosystem. Here are some notable leaders in the Rust community:

* Mozilla: Mozilla was the primary sponsor of Rust's development from its inception until 2021. Mozilla employs several of the core developers of the language and has provided significant financial and technical resources to support Rust's development.

* The Rust Core Team: The Rust Core Team is a group of volunteer developers who are responsible for maintaining the Rust language specification, overseeing the development of the language, and guiding the Rust community. The Core Team is made up of experienced Rust developers who are elected by the community.

* Steve Klabnik: Steve Klabnik is a prominent Rust developer and community leader who has authored several books and articles about Rust, contributed to the development of the language, and helped to promote Rust within the broader software development community.

* Carol Nichols: Carol Nichols is a Rust developer and community leader who has played a significant role in promoting Rust's adoption and educating developers about the language. She is the co-author of the book "The Rust Programming Language" and is a member of the Rust Core Team.

* Ashley Williams: Ashley Williams is a Rust developer and community leader who has been involved in Rust's development and promotion since its early days. She is the co-founder of the Rust Bridge initiative, which provides workshops and resources to help underrepresented groups learn Rust.

These are just a few of the many individuals and organizations that have contributed to Rust's development and success. Rust's community is open and collaborative, and anyone can contribute to the language's development and direction.
