# Pin type for memory location

Rust `Pin` type is a type that is used to express that a value should not be moved in memory. When an object is pinned, it means that its memory location cannot change, even if other parts of the program try to move it.

The `Pin` type is commonly used in Rust when dealing with data structures that hold references to other objects. In such cases, moving the data structure could invalidate the references, leading to undefined behavior.

To create a pinned object, you can use the `Pin::new` function, which takes a reference to the object and returns a `Pin` wrapper around it. This Pin wrapper can then be used to access the object, but it cannot be moved or dropped without first calling the unpin method on it.

Additionally, Rust provides a `Pin<&mut T>` type, which can be used to create a pinned reference to a mutable object. This allows you to modify the object through the reference while still ensuring that its memory location does not change.

Here's an example of how to use Rust Pin type:

```rust
use std::pin::Pin;

struct Data {
    value: i32,
}

impl Data {
    fn new(value: i32) -> Self {
        Self { value }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let data = Data::new(42);
    let pinned_data = Pin::new(&data);
    
    // Attempting to move `data` will result in a compile-time error
    // let moved_data = data;
    
    // Attempting to move `pinned_data` will also result in a compile-time error
    // let moved_pinned_data = pinned_data;

    // We can still access the value of `data` through `pinned_data`
    assert_eq!(42, pinned_data.value);
}
```

In this example, we define a Data struct that holds a single integer value. We then create a new instance of this struct, and use the `Pin::new` function to create a Pin wrapper around a reference to this instance.

Once `pinned_data` is created, attempting to move data will result in a compile-time error. Similarly, attempting to move `pinned_data` will also result in a compile-time error, because it is a wrapper around a pinned reference.

Despite being pinned, we can still access the value of data through `pinned_data`, as shown by the `assert_eq!` statement. This ensures that the reference remains valid, even if the data structure itself is moved.

Overall, Rust Pin `type` is an important tool for ensuring memory safety when dealing with complex data structures and references. It allows you to express the requirement that certain objects should not be moved in memory, which can help prevent bugs and ensure the correctness of your program.
