# Send trait and Sync trait for multithreading

Rust provides two important traits that are related to concurrency and multithreading: Send and Sync.

The Send trait in Rust indicates that a type is safe to be sent across thread boundaries. This means that if a type implements the Send trait, it can be safely passed from one thread to another without causing any data races or undefined behavior. For example, the String type in Rust implements the Send trait, which means it can be safely shared across multiple threads.

The Sync trait in Rust indicates that a type is safe to be shared between multiple threads. This means that if a type implements the Sync trait, it can be safely accessed from multiple threads without causing any data races or undefined behavior. For example, the Arc type in Rust implements the Sync trait, which means it can be safely shared between multiple threads.

To summarize, the Send trait ensures that a type can be safely transferred between threads, while the Sync trait ensures that a type can be safely shared between threads. These traits are important for writing safe and efficient concurrent Rust code.
