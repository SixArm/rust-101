# Rust Programming Guide Book (RPGB)

Rust Programming Guide Book (RPGB) covers hundreds of topics about the Rust programming language and its ecosystem. The focus is on topics and summaries that can help developers learn Rust, understand it, and use it professionally.

Rust Programming Guide Book aims to explain each topic in a broad way, so that any developer can read any topic, in any order, any time. This style works best along with the excellent thorough official Rust documentation book: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Rust Programming Guide Book is created by SixArm and Joel Parker Henderson, with topic content generated by ChatGPT. We welcome constructive feedback, suggestions, and ideas for improvement. We're improving this repo often.
