# Zero-cost abstractions

In Rust, zero-cost abstractions are a design principle that refers to the idea that abstractions, such as functions and data structures, should not impose any runtime overhead compared to the equivalent low-level, manual code that they replace.

This means that, while Rust's standard library provides a high-level API with powerful abstractions, the generated code should be just as fast and efficient as if the code were manually written with lower-level constructs.

To achieve this, Rust uses a combination of static analysis and code generation techniques, such as inlining, loop unrolling, and code specialization. For example, the Rust compiler may choose to inline a function call instead of generating code to jump to the function at runtime, thereby avoiding the overhead of a function call.

Furthermore, Rust's ownership and borrowing system allows the compiler to optimize the generated code by eliminating unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, reducing runtime overhead and improving performance.

This approach allows Rust developers to write high-level code that is easy to read and maintain, while still achieving the performance and efficiency of low-level code. This makes Rust a popular choice for performance-critical applications, such as game engines, web browsers, and operating systems.

Overall, zero-cost abstractions are an important aspect of Rust's design, and they enable Rust to combine high-level abstractions with low-level performance, making it a powerful and efficient language for building complex and performance-critical systems.

## Zero-cost abstractions example

Here's an example of zero-cost abstrations:

```
fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output=T>>(x: T, y: T) -> T {
    x + y
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    let z = add(x, y);
    println!("{}", z);
}
```

In this example, the `add` function takes two arguments of any type that implements the `Add` trait, adds them together using `+`, and returns the result. This function is generic, so it can be used with any type that implements `Add`, such as numbers, strings, or even custom objects.

Because the function is generic, it will be optimized by the Rust compiler to perform as efficiently as possible. This means that using the `add` function will not incur any additional runtime overhead, even though it uses an abstraction (the `Add` trait) to make the function more generic and reusable.

In this way, Rust demonstrates the concept of zero-cost abstraction, allowing developers to write modular, reusable code without sacrificing performance.
