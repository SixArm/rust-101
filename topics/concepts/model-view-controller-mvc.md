# Model-view-controller (MVC)

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering for developing user interfaces. It provides a way to separate an application's data (the Model), user interface (the View), and control logic (the Controller) into separate components, which helps in making the code more modular, easier to understand, and maintain.

In the context of Rust, the Model-View-Controller pattern is often used in web application development, where the Model represents the application's data, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller acts as the glue between the two.

Here's how the components work together in Rust's MVC pattern:

* Model: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It defines the data structures and operations for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data. In a web application, the Model typically interacts with a database or other persistent storage to retrieve and store data.

* View: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It defines the user interface elements, such as HTML templates, and renders the data provided by the Controller. In a web application, the View generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the user sees in their browser.

* Controller: The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and View components. It receives input from the user, processes it, and updates the Model as necessary. It also retrieves data from the Model and passes it to the View for rendering. In a web application, the Controller handles HTTP requests and responses, and performs any necessary data validation and business logic.

By separating the application's data, user interface, and control logic into separate components, the MVC pattern makes it easier to maintain and modify the application. For example, if you want to change the user interface, you can modify the View without affecting the underlying data or business logic. Similarly, if you want to change the way data is stored or manipulated, you can modify the Model without affecting the user interface.
