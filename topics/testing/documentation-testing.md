# Documentation testing

Rust doc tests are a form of Rust's testing framework that allows developers to include tests in the documentation of their code. This allows developers to write code examples and tests in the documentation itself, ensuring that the documentation remains up-to-date and accurate.

Here are the steps involved in using Rust doc tests:

* Write the doc tests: Rust doc tests are written as code examples in the documentation of a Rust function or module. The code examples should demonstrate the expected behavior of the function or module.

* Use Rust's testing framework: Rust's testing framework provides a set of macros and functions for writing and running tests. The `#[cfg(test)]` attribute indicates that a Rust module contains tests.

* Include the doc tests in the documentation: Rust's documentation system will automatically recognize and run the doc tests included in the documentation of a function or module.

* Run the tests: Doc tests in Rust can be run using the `cargo test --doc` command. This command compiles and runs all the doc tests in the project.

* Analyze the test results: After the tests have run, the output of the tests can be analyzed to determine whether the doc tests have passed or failed. Rust's testing framework provides detailed information about the tests that have been run, including the number of tests that have passed or failed and the reason for the failures.

By following these steps, developers can use Rust doc tests to validate the examples and expected behavior included in the documentation of their code, ensuring that the documentation remains accurate and up-to-date.
