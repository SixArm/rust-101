# Unit testing

Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual software components or units are tested in isolation to ensure that they behave as expected. In Rust, unit testing involves writing tests that validate the expected behavior of functions, methods, and other individual units of code.

Rust provides a built-in testing framework for unit testing called `cargo test`. Here are the steps involved in Rust unit testing:

* Write the unit tests: Unit tests in Rust are typically placed in the same file as the code they are testing. These tests should be written to validate the expected behavior of individual functions or methods.

* Use Rust's testing framework: Rust's testing framework provides a set of macros and functions for writing and running tests. The `#[cfg(test)]` attribute indicates that a Rust module contains tests.

* Write test assertions: Rust's testing framework provides a set of assertions that can be used to validate the output of functions or methods being tested. These assertions can be used to check that a value is equal to an expected value, that a value is greater than or less than an expected value, and other conditions.

* Run the tests: Unit tests in Rust can be run using the `cargo test` command. This command compiles and runs all the tests in the project, including the unit tests.

* Analyze the test results: After the tests have run, the output of the tests can be analyzed to determine whether the unit tests have passed or failed. Rust's testing framework provides detailed information about the tests that have been run, including the number of tests that have passed or failed and the reason for the failures.

By following these steps, developers can use Rust's unit testing framework to validate the behavior of individual components of the software, ensuring that each unit behaves as expected and functions correctly as part of the larger system.
