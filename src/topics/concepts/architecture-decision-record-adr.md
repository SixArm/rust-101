# Architecture decision record (ADR) 

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures important architectural decisions made during the development of software solutions. It is used to communicate the reasoning and the justification behind the choices made, as well as their potential impact on the overall architecture of the system.

The ADR explains the problem being addressed and the decision that was made to solve it. It provides a detailed description of the decision-making process, including the factors considered, the alternatives evaluated, and the risks involved.

The ADR serves as a living document that can be referred to throughout the development process, providing insight into the design philosophy and decision-making process of the team. It can also provide a historical record of the reasons behind decisions, which can help future development teams understand the thought process and avoid repeating past mistakes.

Overall, an Architecture Decision Record is a useful tool for maintaining transparency and sharing knowledge among development teams, ensuring that important decisions are recorded and communicated effectively.

Title: Introduction of Rust in the Tech Stack

Status: Accepted

Context: Our current tech stack relies heavily on languages like C++, Python, and Java for development. However, the team has been experiencing difficulties in maintaining a codebase that is highly performant and secure. We need to explore options that provide better memory safety, concurrency support, and improved performance. After researching various options, we would like to introduce Rust as a new programming language for developing certain modules within our application.

Decision: We have decided to introduce Rust programming language in our tech stack to improve the performance and security of our codebase. Rust's unique features such as memory safety, concurrency support, and ability to create efficient software with minimal overhead make it a suitable choice for our team.

Consequences: The decision to introduce Rust may require additional training for our development team, which could impact project timelines. However, we believe that the long-term benefits of using Rust will outweigh any short-term challenges. With Rust, we anticipate improved performance, better memory safety, and maintenance of a secure codebase. Additionally, the introduction of Rust could help us attract new developers who are interested in working with this cutting-edge language.
