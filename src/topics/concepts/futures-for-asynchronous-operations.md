# Futures for asynchronous operations

In Rust, a future is a type that represents an asynchronous operation that may not have completed yet. Futures provide a powerful mechanism for writing non-blocking, asynchronous code that can perform I/O operations, such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request, without blocking the main thread.

Rust's futures are composable, which means that multiple futures can be combined to create more complex workflows. Futures can be chained together to form a pipeline, with each future representing a step in the pipeline. When one future completes, it can trigger the next future in the pipeline to begin executing.

Futures are executed by an executor, which is responsible for scheduling and running the futures. Rust provides several built-in executors, including a basic executor that runs all futures on the same thread.

Here's an example of using Rust Futures for an asynchronous HTTP request:

```rust
use futures::Future;
use reqwest::Url;

async fn fetch_url(url: Url) -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    Ok(body)
}

fn main() {
    let url = Url::parse("https://example.com").unwrap();
    let future = fetch_url(url);
    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(future).unwrap();
}
```

This example defines an asynchronous function `fetch_url` that takes a `Url` and returns a `Result<String, reqwest::Error>`. The function uses the `reqwest` crate library to make an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, and returns the response body as a string. 

When we call `fetch_url`, the function returns a `Future` that we store in a variable. We use the tokio runtime to run the `Future` and block until it completes. Finally, we print the result.
