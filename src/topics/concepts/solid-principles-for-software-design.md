# SOLID principles for software design

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to make software designs more flexible, maintainable, and easy to understand.

In Rust, these principles can be applied to help developers write code that is easier to maintain and extend over time. Here is a brief overview of each of the SOLID principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a module or class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a module should have only one responsibility or job, and it should not be responsible for doing more than that. This helps to keep the code more organized, easier to understand, and more maintainable.

* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that a module or class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the functionality of a module or class without having to modify its existing code. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain over time.

* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that a subclass should be able to replace its parent class without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that a subclass should be able to behave as expected by the client code, without requiring any modifications to the client code. This helps to ensure that code is more modular and easier to maintain.

* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle states that a module or class should only expose the methods and properties that are necessary for its clients. In other words, a module or class should not force its clients to depend on methods or properties that they do not need. This helps to reduce dependencies and make the code more maintainable.

* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules or classes should not depend on low-level modules or classes, but on abstractions. This means that you should define interfaces and abstractions to represent the dependencies in your code, rather than depending directly on concrete implementations. This helps to make the code more flexible, easier to test, and easier to maintain.
