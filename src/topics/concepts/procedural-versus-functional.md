# Procedural versus functional

Pprocedural programming and functional programming are two different paradigms of software development. Rust supports both procedural and functional programming styles, and developers can choose which style to use based on the specific requirements of their application.

In procedural programming, code is organized around procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. Procedural code is typically organized in a linear fashion, with each function calling other functions to perform the necessary operations. In procedural programming, the focus is on the step-by-step instructions necessary to solve a problem, rather than on data transformations.

In Rust, procedural code is often used for low-level systems programming tasks, where performance is critical. For example, writing code to interact with hardware devices or to implement low-level algorithms may require a procedural style.

Functional programming, on the other hand, focuses on the transformation of data through the use of pure functions. A pure function is a function that produces a result based only on its input, and has no side effects. In functional programming, the emphasis is on the composition of functions to create more complex operations, rather than on step-by-step procedures.

In Rust, functional programming is often used for higher-level programming tasks, such as data analysis and web development. Rust's support for functional programming is largely due to its support for closures, higher-order functions, and immutable data structures.

In summary, Rust supports both procedural and functional programming styles, and developers can choose which style to use based on the specific requirements of their application. Procedural programming is often used for lower-level programming, while functional programming is often used for higher-level programming.
