# prost crate for protocol buffers

The Rust prost crate is a code generator and runtime library for Protocol Buffers, a language-agnostic data serialization format originally developed by Google. The crate enables Rust developers to define Protocol Buffer messages in Rust code, which are then compiled into serialization and deserialization code at build time. 

The generated code provides a strongly-typed API for working with Protocol Buffer messages, enabling efficient serialization and deserialization of data. The runtime library provides functions for reading and writing Protocol Buffer messages to and from files or streams, as well as utilities for working with message fields, extensions and enumerations.

In summary, the Rust prost crate simplifies the process of working with Protocol Buffers in Rust, enabling efficient and safe data serialization and deserialization, while also providing a granular API for working with message fields and structures.

Here is example code that demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize a simple protobuf message.

```rust
use prost::Message;

// Define a simple protobuf message
#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Message)]
pub struct MyMessage {
    #[prost(int32, tag="1")]
    pub my_field: i32,
}

// Serialize the message to bytes
let message = MyMessage { my_field: 42 };
let mut bytes = Vec::new();
message.encode(&mut bytes).unwrap();

// Deserialize the message from bytes
let decoded = MyMessage::decode(bytes.as_slice()).unwrap();

// Verify the decoded message is the same as the original
assert_eq!(message, decoded);
```

In this example code, we define a simple protobuf message `MyMessage` with a single field `my_field`. We use Prost's `#[derive(Message)]` macro to generate the serialization and deserialization code for this message.

We then create an instance of `MyMessage`, serialize it to bytes using the `encode()` method, and deserialize it back to a `MyMessage` instance using the `decode()` method.

Finally, we verify that the serialized and deserialized messages are equal using the `assert_eq()` macro.
