# axum crate for web services

<https://crates.io/crates/axum>

The Rust axum crate provides a fast, low-level web framework for building microservices and APIs. Axum is designed to be easy to use, performant, and composable, meaning you can mix and match components to build a custom web application that meets your needs.

Axum is built on top of Rust's async/await syntax and uses Tokio as its underlying async runtime. This means that Axum is well-suited for building high-performance, non-blocking web services that can handle a large number of concurrent requests.

Axum provides a number of features that make it a powerful tool for building web applications, including:

* Routing: Axum makes it easy to define routes for your web application, allowing you to map URLs to specific functions or handlers.

* Middleware: Axum supports middleware, which are functions that can be run before or after a request is processed. Middleware can be used for things like logging, authentication, and authorization.

* Error handling: Axum provides a flexible error handling system that allows you to handle errors in a way that makes sense for your application.

* Testing: Axum includes tools for testing your web application, making it easy to write automated tests for your code.

Overall, Rust axum is well-suited for building microservices and APIs. If you're looking for a fast, low-level framework that gives you complete control over your web application, then Axum is definitely worth considering.

Here's an example of using the axum crate to build a web service in Rust:

```rust
use axum::{handler::get, Router};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(hello_world));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));

    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);

    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this example, we use the axum crate to define a simple web service that responds to HTTP GET requests to the root URL with a "Hello, world!" message.

First, we define an asynchronous function called `hello_world` that returns the static string "Hello, world!".

Next, we define a router using the `Router::new()` function, and use the `route()` method to define a route that maps the root URL (`"/"`) to the hello_world handler function.

We then create a SocketAddr object representing the address and port on which the web service will listen (`127.0.0.1:3000`), and print a message indicating that the service is listening on that address.

Finally, we use the `axum::Server` type to bind the address to the web service, and serve it using the `serve()` method.
