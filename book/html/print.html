<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-rust-hello-world-program"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-rust-hello-world-program">What is a Rust &quot;hello world&quot; program?</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a simple &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program is:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program contains a single function, <code>main()</code>, which is the entry point for the program. The function body is enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code> and contains a single statement:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This statement prints the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console using Rust's standard library macro <code>println!()</code>. The <code>println!()</code> macro is a convenient way to print formatted text to the console, and in this case, it simply prints the string literal &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.</p>
<p>When you run this program, you should see the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; printed to the console.</p>
<p>To create this program, the typical way is to use the Rust <code>cargo</code> package manager, which can create an example project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo new hello
cd hello
</code></pre>
<p>Then edit the <code>src/main.rs</code> file, which is automatically created with the &quot;hello world&quot; code above. Change it as you wish.</p>
<p>To run the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo run
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-rust-fizzbuzz-program"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-rust-fizzbuzz-program">What is a Rust &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; program?</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a simple &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; program is:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        if i % 3 == 0 &amp;&amp; i % 5 == 0 {
            println!(&quot;FizzBuzz&quot;);
        } else if i % 3 == 0 {
            println!(&quot;Fizz&quot;);
        } else if i % 5 == 0 {
            println!(&quot;Buzz&quot;);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i);
        }
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program prints the numbers 1 to 100, but replaces multiples of 3 with &quot;Fizz&quot;, multiples of 5 with &quot;Buzz&quot;, and multiples of both 3 and 5 with &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;. This program uses a Rust <code>for</code> loop statement, some Rust <code>if</code> control flow statements that use the <code>%</code> modulo operator and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> logical operator, and some <code>println!</code> macros to print lines to the console.</p>
<p>When you run this program, you should see lines printed to the console, starting with these lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-makes-rust-good"><a class="header" href="#what-makes-rust-good">What makes Rust good?</a></h1>
<p>There are a variety reasons why Rust is considered a good programming language and good for developers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance: Rust is designed to provide high performance and low-level control, making i* an excellent choice for systems programming. Its memory safety guarantees, achieved throug* its ownership and borrowing system, allow it to be fast without sacrificing safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety: Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that programs are safe and free fro* common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and dat* races. Rust is designed to prevent undefined behavior and make it difficult to write unsaf* code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency: Rust's design is well-suited for concurrent and parallel programming. It* ownership and borrowing system make it easier to write code that is thread-safe and can b* run in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community: Rust has a large and active community that is dedicated to improving the languag* and its ecosystem. The community provides excellent documentation, libraries, and tools tha* make it easier to learn and use Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-platform support: Rust can be used to write code for a wide range of platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web applications. Rust also has excellent support for compiling to WebAssembly, which makes it possible to write high-performance web applications in Rust.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Rust's combination of performance, safety, concurrency, community, and cross-platform support make it an excellent programming language for a wide range of applications.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="is-programming-language-theory-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#is-programming-language-theory-in-rust">Is programming language theory in Rust?</a></h1>
<p>The Rust programming language was designed with a strong focus on safety, speed, and concurrency, and informed by various programming language (PL) theories, such as type theory, ownership theory, and concurrency theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies types and their relationships. In Rust, type theory ensures that programs are safe and correct at compile-time. Rust has a strong type system that allows the compiler to catch errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile-time, rather than at runtime. Rust's type system is also expressive and flexible, allowing developers to write code that is both safe and efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ownership theory is a concept that is unique to Rust. Ownership refers to the idea that every piece of memory in a Rust program has an owner, and there can only be one owner at a time. Ownership prevents data races and other memory safety issues that can occur in concurrent programs. In Rust, ownership is enforced at compile-time, and the compiler ensures that the rules of ownership are followed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency theory is the study of concurrent programming, which is the process of writing programs that execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Rust's design is informed by concurrency theory, and it provides several features for writing concurrent programs, such as threads, channels, and futures. Rust's concurrency features are designed to be safe and efficient, allowing developers to write concurrent programs that are both fast and reliable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Rust's design is informed by various programming language theories, and it combines these concepts in a unique way to provide a language that is safe, fast, and concurrent. By using type theory, ownership theory, and concurrency theory, Rust provides a powerful tool for writing systems software that is both reliable and efficient.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-are-the-hardest-parts-of-rust"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-hardest-parts-of-rust">What are the hardest parts of Rust?</a></h1>
<p>While Rust is a powerful programming language with many benefits, it can also have some challenges. Here are some of the hardest parts of Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ownership and Borrowing: Rust's ownership and borrowing system is one of its most unique and powerful features, but it can also be one of the most challenging to learn. Understanding ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes can take time and practice, especially for those who are used to garbage-collected or reference-counted languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error messages: While Rust's error messages are known for being helpful and informative, they can also be overwhelming for new users. Rust's borrow checker is very strict, and its error messages can sometimes be difficult to understand, especially when dealing with complex borrowing situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Macros: Rust's macro system is a powerful tool for metaprogramming, but it can also be challenging to use. Macros require a deep understanding of Rust's syntax and type system, and they can be difficult to debug when something goes wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax: Rust's syntax can be verbose and sometimes difficult to read, especially for those who are used to more concise or expressive languages. This can make it harder to write clean, readable code, especially for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited ecosystem: While Rust's ecosystem is growing rapidly, it is still relatively small compared to other languages. This can make it harder to find libraries and tools for certain tasks, and it can also make it harder to find experienced Rust developers to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while Rust can have some challenging aspects, it is a powerful and rewarding language to learn for those who are willing to put in the time and effort.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-rust-missing"><a class="header" href="#what-is-rust-missing">What is Rust missing?</a></h1>
<p>While Rust is a powerful and versatile language, there are still some areas where it may be lacking in comparison to other languages. Here are a few things that Rust may be missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mature ecosystem: Rust is still a relatively new language, and as a result, its ecosystem is still developing. Some libraries or tools may not be as fully-featured or mature as those available in more established languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slower compilation times: Rust's powerful type system and borrow checker can result in longer compilation times compared to other languages. This can be a drawback for developers who require faster feedback cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited support for garbage collection: Rust does not have built-in support for garbage collection, which can make it more difficult to manage memory in some cases. While Rust's ownership and borrowing system provides safety guarantees and avoids issues such as memory leaks, it can also require more careful management of memory allocation and deallocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning curve: Rust has a steep learning curve, especially for developers who are not familiar with low-level systems programming or functional programming concepts. This can make it challenging for developers to become proficient in the language quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited support for some platforms: While Rust has good support for Linux and other popular platforms, support for some niche platforms or hardware may be limited. This can be a concern for developers working on specialized projects that require support for these platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that many of these limitations are being actively addressed by the Rust community, and the language continues to evolve and improve over time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-do-companies-not-use-rust"><a class="header" href="#why-do-companies-not-use-rust">Why do companies not use Rust?</a></h1>
<p>While Rust has gained a lot of popularity and adoption in recent years, some companies may still be hesitant to adopt the language for various reasons. Here are some potential reasons why companies may avoid Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of expertise: Rust is a relatively new language and may not yet have a large pool of experienced developers compared to more established languages like Java or Python. Companies may be hesitant to adopt Rust if they do not have the in-house expertise or resources to develop and maintain Rust code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legacy code: Many companies have existing codebases written in other languages, and transitioning to Rust may require significant time and resources. Companies may be hesitant to make this investment if the benefits of using Rust are not clear or if there are alternative solutions available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited ecosystem: While Rust's ecosystem is growing rapidly, it may not yet have the same level of library support or tooling as more established languages. This can make it more difficult or time-consuming for companies to develop and maintain Rust code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning curve: Rust's syntax and concepts can be challenging for developers who are not already familiar with low-level systems programming or functional programming concepts. Companies may be hesitant to adopt Rust if they anticipate a steep learning curve for their development teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk aversion: Some companies may be risk-averse and may prefer to stick with more established languages that have a proven track record of success. Rust is still a relatively new language and may be perceived as less stable or less reliable compared to more established languages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that these reasons may not apply to all companies, and many companies have successfully adopted Rust and reaped the benefits of the language's safety and performance guarantees. Additionally, many of these concerns are actively being addressed by the Rust community, with ongoing efforts to improve the language's ecosystem and make it more accessible to developers of all backgrounds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="borrow-checker"><a class="header" href="#borrow-checker">Borrow checker</a></h1>
<p>The Rust borrow checker is a tool that ensures memory safety in Rust programs by preventing data races and other forms of undefined behavior related to memory management. In Rust, memory is managed through a system of ownership and borrowing, where ownership represents exclusive control over a piece of memory, and borrowing represents temporary access to that memory.</p>
<p>When a variable is created in Rust, it becomes the owner of the memory it represents. The owner is responsible for freeing the memory when the variable goes out of scope. However, Rust also allows you to borrow references to the memory owned by another variable, but with certain constraints. The borrow checker enforces these constraints to prevent invalid memory access and data races.</p>
<p>The borrow checker analyzes Rust code to ensure that each reference to memory is valid and safe. It enforces a set of rules that govern how and when references can be created, used, and dropped. These rules include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only one mutable reference to a piece of memory can exist at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutable references can't coexist with immutable references to the same piece of memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References must always be valid and non-null.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lifetime of a reference must be shorter than the lifetime of the memory it refers to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The borrow checker is an important part of Rust's memory safety guarantees and has become one of the most notable features of the language. It can be challenging to work with at first, especially for developers coming from languages without similar constraints, but it ultimately helps catch many memory-related bugs at compile time rather than at runtime.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="channels-for-thread-communication"><a class="header" href="#channels-for-thread-communication">Channels for thread communication</a></h1>
<p>Rust channels are a way to facilitate communication between threads in Rust. They allow threads to send messages to each other in a synchronized and safe manner, without the need for explicit locking or other synchronization primitives.</p>
<p>In Rust, channels are created using the <code>std::sync::mpsc</code> module, which stands for &quot;multiple producer, single consumer.&quot; This means that multiple threads can send messages into a channel, but there will only be one thread receiving those messages.</p>
<p>To create a channel, you first need to import the module, then you can send messages and receive messages.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::mpsc;
fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(); // create a channel
    sender.send(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;).unwrap(); // send a message
    let message = receiver.recv().unwrap(); // receive a message
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If there are no messages in the channel, the <code>recv</code> method will block until a message is available. Alternatively, you can use the <code>try_recv</code> method to receive a message without blocking:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>match receiver.try_recv() {
    Ok(message) =&gt; println!(&quot;Received message: {}&quot;, message),
    Err(_) =&gt; println!(&quot;No message received&quot;),
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>It's important to note that sending and receiving messages through a Rust channel takes ownership of the values being sent. This means that the value being sent is moved into the channel, and can no longer be used by the sender after the send operation. Similarly, the value received from the channel is moved out of the channel, and can no longer be received by any other threads. This ownership model ensures that Rust channels are safe and thread-safe.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="concurrency-and-parallelism"><a class="header" href="#concurrency-and-parallelism">Concurrency and parallelism</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, concurrency refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks or operations at the same time, while parallelism refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks or operations simultaneously, using multiple processors or cores.</p>
<p>Rust provides several mechanisms for concurrency and parallelism, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Threads: Rust's standard library provides a low-level interface for creating and managing threads. Threads allow a program to execute multiple tasks in parallel, but require careful synchronization to avoid data races and other concurrency issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channels: Rust's channels provide a high-level mechanism for communication between threads. Channels allow multiple threads to send and receive data, and ensure that the data is transmitted in a synchronized and safe manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Futures: Rust's futures provide a mechanism for asynchronous programming, allowing a program to perform non-blocking I/O and other operations without blocking the main thread. Futures are composable and can be combined to create complex asynchronous workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atomic types: Rust's atomic types provide a safe and efficient way to share data between threads. Atomic types are designed to be thread-safe, and provide operations that ensure that data is updated atomically, without the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust's concurrency and parallelism mechanisms are designed to be safe and efficient, and take advantage of Rust's ownership and borrowing system to prevent data races and other concurrency issues. Additionally, Rust's compiler provides powerful static analysis and optimization tools that can help identify and eliminate potential issues in concurrent and parallel code.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust's concurrency and parallelism mechanisms provide a powerful and flexible toolkit for building concurrent and parallel programs, while ensuring that the code remains safe and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-details"><a class="header" href="#concurrency-details">Concurrency details</a></h2>
<p>Rust concurrency is based on the ownership and borrowing model, which guarantees memory safety and eliminates data races.</p>
<p>Rust has several concurrency primitives, such as threads, channels, mutexes, and atomic operations. Rust's threading model is based on the fork-join model, where a program creates multiple threads to perform different tasks, and the threads join back together at the end.</p>
<p>Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates Rust concurrency using threads:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let mut handles = vec![];
    for i in 0..5 {
        // Create a new thread
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            println!(&quot;Hello from thread {}&quot;, i);
        });
        // Store the thread handle
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>thread::spawn()</code> function creates a new thread, and the <code>move</code> keyword moves the variable <code>i</code> into the closure. The closure prints a message indicating which thread it is running on.</p>
<p>The <code>handles</code> vector stores the handles of all the threads that were created. Finally, the <code>join()</code> method is called on each thread handle to wait for the thread to finish before exiting the program.</p>
<p>This is just a basic example, but Rust's concurrency primitives can be combined in various ways to build more complex and efficient concurrent programs.</p>
<h2 id="parallelism-details"><a class="header" href="#parallelism-details">Parallelism details</a></h2>
<p>Rust has built-in support for parallelism, which is the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple processors or cores. </p>
<p>Rust's support for parallelism is especially easy to use by adding the Rust <code>rayon</code> crate, which provides a high-level API for parallel programming. The <code>rayon</code> crate allows developers to easily parallelize data processing tasks, such as iterating over large collections, by abstracting away the low-level details of thread creation and synchronization.</p>
<p>Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates Rust parallelism using rayon:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use rayon::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    let sum = numbers.par_iter().sum::&lt;i32&gt;();
    println!(&quot;Sum is {}&quot;, sum);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>par_iter()</code> method creates a parallel iterator over a vector of numbers. The <code>sum()</code> method is then called on the iterator to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the vector.</p>
<p><code>rayon</code> automatically divides the work among multiple threads, using as many threads as there are processors or cores available on the system. The code is executed in parallel, with each thread processing a subset of the data.</p>
<p>The <code>par_iter()</code> method can be used with many other methods of the standard library, such as <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code>, to parallelize various data processing tasks.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust's support for parallelism allows developers to take advantage of modern hardware and achieve high performance in their applications without sacrificing safety and correctness.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="error-messages"><a class="header" href="#error-messages">Error messages</a></h1>
<p>Rust is known for having particularly helpful and informative error messages compared to other programming languages. Rust's error messages are designed to be both human-readable and actionable, providing developers with clear guidance on how to fix issues in their code.</p>
<p>Here are some key features of Rust error messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contextual information: Rust's error messages typically include contextual information such as the location and type of the error, as well as relevant code snippets and variable values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggested fixes: In many cases, Rust will provide suggested fixes for common errors, such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable types. These suggestions can save developers time and make it easier to correct errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explanation of the problem: Rust's error messages often include detailed explanations of the problem, helping developers to understand the underlying issue and how to avoid it in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help with complex concepts: Rust's error messages can also help with complex concepts like ownership and borrowing. The messages will often explain how Rust's ownership system works and suggest ways to restructure code to avoid common pitfalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear formatting: Rust's error messages are designed to be easy to read and understand, with clear formatting and helpful color coding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Rust's error messages are a powerful tool for developers, helping them to identify and fix issues in their code quickly and efficiently. They are a testament to Rust's focus on developer experience and the language's commitment to making it easy to write safe and efficient code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="foreign-function-interface-ffi"><a class="header" href="#foreign-function-interface-ffi">Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) allows Rust code to interoperate with code written in other languages, such as C or C++. This enables Rust to be used in mixed-language projects or to use existing libraries that are written in other languages.</p>
<p>To use the FFI in Rust, you first need to declare an external function or type from another language using the <code>extern</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn some_function(arg1: i32, arg2: *mut i32) -&gt; i32;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This declares a function called <code>some_function</code> that takes an <code>i32</code> and a pointer to an <code>i32</code> as arguments and returns an <code>i32</code>. The &quot;C&quot; string in the <code>extern</code> declaration specifies the calling convention, which tells the Rust compiler how to interact with the external function.</p>
<p>To call this function from Rust, you can use the <code>unsafe</code> keyword to tell the Rust compiler that the function call is unsafe and may have side effects:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let arg1 = 42;
let mut arg2 = 0;
let result = unsafe { some_function(arg1, &amp;mut arg2) };
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This calls the <code>some_function</code> function with the specified arguments, passing a mutable reference to <code>arg2</code> using the <code>&amp;mut</code> operator.</p>
<p>Rust also provides a <code>#[no_mangle]</code> attribute that can be used to disable Rust's name mangling, which can be useful when interacting with external libraries. For example, you can declare a Rust function with the <code>#[no_mangle]</code> attribute and call it from C code.</p>
<p>In summary, the Rust FFI enables Rust code to interoperate with code written in other languages, and can be used to call external functions from Rust or to expose Rust functions to other languages.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="futures-for-asynchronous-operations"><a class="header" href="#futures-for-asynchronous-operations">Futures for asynchronous operations</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a future is a type that represents an asynchronous operation that may not have completed yet. Futures provide a powerful mechanism for writing non-blocking, asynchronous code that can perform I/O operations, such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request, without blocking the main thread.</p>
<p>Rust's futures are composable, which means that multiple futures can be combined to create more complex workflows. Futures can be chained together to form a pipeline, with each future representing a step in the pipeline. When one future completes, it can trigger the next future in the pipeline to begin executing.</p>
<p>Futures are executed by an executor, which is responsible for scheduling and running the futures. Rust provides several built-in executors, including a basic executor that runs all futures on the same thread.</p>
<p>Here's an example of using Rust Futures for an asynchronous HTTP request:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use futures::Future;
use reqwest::Url;

async fn fetch_url(url: Url) -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    Ok(body)
}

fn main() {
    let url = Url::parse(&quot;https://example.com&quot;).unwrap();
    let future = fetch_url(url);
    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(future).unwrap();
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This example defines an asynchronous function <code>fetch_url</code> that takes a <code>Url</code> and returns a <code>Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt;</code>. The function uses the <code>reqwest</code> crate library to make an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, and returns the response body as a string. </p>
<p>When we call <code>fetch_url</code>, the function returns a <code>Future</code> that we store in a variable. We use the tokio runtime to run the <code>Future</code> and block until it completes. Finally, we print the result.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monomorphisation"><a class="header" href="#monomorphisation">Monomorphisation</a></h1>
<p>Rust monomorphization is a process where generic code is transformed into specific code for each concrete type used in the program. In other words, it is the process of generating specialized code for each type that is used in a generic function or struct. </p>
<p>This is different from traditional dynamic dispatch, where a function or method call is resolved at runtime, based on the type of the object or value being operated on. With monomorphization, the specific implementation of a generic function is determined at compile-time, and there is no runtime overhead associated with dynamic dispatch. </p>
<p>Overall, monomorphization makes Rust code faster and more efficient than code that relies on dynamic dispatch.</p>
<p>Here's an example of monomorphism in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn add&lt;T: std::ops::Add&lt;Output=T&gt;&gt;(a: T, b: T) -&gt; T {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let int_sum = add(1, 2);
    let float_sum = add(1.0, 2.0);

    println!(&quot;Integer sum: {}&quot;, int_sum);
    println!(&quot;Float sum: {}&quot;, float_sum);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the add function takes two arguments of type <code>T</code>, which must implement the <code>std::ops::Add trait</code>, and returns their sum of the same type <code>T</code>. Because the type parameter <code>T</code> is constrained to implement <code>std::ops::Add</code>, the compiler can statically determine the concrete type of <code>T</code> at compile-time, resulting in monomorphic code that is optimized for the specific types used.</p>
<p>In the <code>main</code> function, we call add twice: once with integers and once with floats. Since Rust uses monomorphization, the compiler generates two separate versions of the add function, one for integers and one for floats. This results in efficient and optimized code without the overhead of dynamic dispatch.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-stable-versus-rust-nightly"><a class="header" href="#rust-stable-versus-rust-nightly">Rust stable versus Rust nightly</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, there are two main channels of development for the compiler and language: the Rust stable channel and the Rust nightly channel.</p>
<p>The Rust stable channel is the main release channel for Rust, where only stable and well-tested features are included. The goal of this channel is to provide a stable and reliable Rust experience for most users. The stable channel has a predictable release schedule and is recommended for most users.</p>
<p>The Rust nightly channel is a more experimental channel that contains bleeding-edge features that are still under development. The nightly channel is updated more frequently than the stable channel, and it may contain features that are not yet stable or well-tested. The nightly channel is intended for developers who want to experiment with new features, contribute to the Rust project, or provide early feedback on new features.</p>
<p>Some features are only available on the nightly channel, while others are only available on the stable channel. In general, the Rust team works to stabilize features as quickly as possible and move them to the stable channel.</p>
<p>To switch between the stable and nightly channels, you can use the rustup tool. </p>
<p>To switch to the latest stable version of Rust, you can run:</p>
<pre><code>rustup default stable
</code></pre>
<p>To switch to the latest nightly version of Rust, you can run:</p>
<pre><code>rustup default nightly
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, the choice between the stable and nightly channels depends on your needs. If you want a stable and reliable Rust experience, you should use the stable channel. If you want to experiment with new features or contribute to the Rust project, you may want to use the nightly channel.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unsafe-code"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-code">Unsafe code</a></h1>
<p>Rust is a programming language that prioritizes safety and correctness. However, there are situations where you may need to bypass Rust's built-in safety checks to perform certain operations. In these cases, Rust provides a way to write unsafe code within a safe Rust program.</p>
<p>Unsafe code is Rust code that the compiler cannot verify for safety at compile-time. This code is typically used when working with low-level operations that require direct access to system resources or when interacting with code written in other programming languages.</p>
<p>In unsafe code, Rust allows the use of several features that are not permitted in safe code, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dereferencing raw pointers: Raw pointers are unmanaged pointers that do not have any safety guarantees. Dereferencing raw pointers can lead to undefined behavior, such as null pointer dereferences, use-after-free errors, and other memory-related bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calling unsafe functions: Unsafe functions are Rust functions that are marked with the unsafe keyword. These functions can perform operations that are not safe to perform in safe Rust code, such as accessing memory directly or performing system-level operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifying global state: Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that data is accessed safely and not modified concurrently. However, in unsafe code, you can bypass these guarantees and modify global state directly, which can lead to race conditions and other issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that just because code is marked as unsafe doesn't mean it's inherently dangerous or incorrect. Unsafe code is often necessary for performance-critical code, interfacing with external systems, or implementing low-level abstractions.</p>
<p>However, writing and working with unsafe code requires a deep understanding of Rust's memory and ownership model, as well as a strong understanding of the system being interfaced with. Rust also provides several tools, such as unsafe blocks, to help ensure that unsafe code is written and used correctly.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="webassembly-wasm"><a class="header" href="#webassembly-wasm">WebAssembly (WASM)</a></h1>
<p>WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format that allows code to be executed in a sandboxed environment on web browsers, outside of the JavaScript runtime. Rust is one of the programming languages that can be compiled to WebAssembly, which allows Rust code to be executed in web browsers and other WASM environments.</p>
<p>Rust's support for WebAssembly comes through the Rust stdweb and wasm-bindgen crates, which provide tools for interacting with the WASM environment from Rust code. These crates allow Rust code to be compiled to WASM and provide a bridge between Rust and JavaScript, enabling Rust functions to be called from JavaScript and vice versa.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of using Rust for WebAssembly is performance. Rust's focus on low-level control and efficient memory management make it a good fit for WASM, which has similar performance requirements to native code. Additionally, Rust's ownership and borrowing model can help prevent memory-related bugs in WASM code, which is especially important in the security-sensitive environment of the web.</p>
<p>Rust's support for WebAssembly also extends beyond the web. WASM can be run in a variety of environments, including mobile devices, IoT devices, and server-side applications. Rust's cross-platform support and memory safety features make it a good choice for developing WASM applications that can run on a variety of platforms.</p>
<p>To use the WASM crate, add the dependency to your project <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = &quot;0.2.72&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, Rust's support for WebAssembly makes it a powerful tool for developing high-performance, secure, and cross-platform applications that can be executed in a variety of environments, including web browsers.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<h2 id="webassembly-wasm-example"><a class="header" href="#webassembly-wasm-example">WebAssembly (WASM) example</a></h2>
<p>Create a new Rust project, such as running <code>cargo new wasm-example --lib</code>, and add the <code>wasm-bindgen</code> dependency to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. </p>
<p>In your <code>lib.rs</code> file, add the <code>wasm_bindgen</code> macro to the top of the file, and define a simple Rust function that takes two numbers and returns their sum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Build your Rust code as a WebAssembly module by running the following command, which creates a WASM file called <code>wasm-example.wasm</code> in the <code>target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, create a JavaScript file that loads the WASM module and calls your Rust function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import(&quot;./wasm_example_bg.wasm&quot;).then((module) =&gt; {
  const { add } = module;
  console.log(add(1, 2)); // outputs 3
});
</code></pre>
<p>This JavaScript code loads the WASM module using the <code>import()</code> function, which is a new feature in JavaScript that allows you to dynamically load modules at runtime. Once the module is loaded, you can call your Rust function using the <code>add</code> variable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="zero-cost-abstractions"><a class="header" href="#zero-cost-abstractions">Zero-cost abstractions</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, zero-cost abstractions are a design principle that refers to the idea that abstractions, such as functions and data structures, should not impose any runtime overhead compared to the equivalent low-level, manual code that they replace.</p>
<p>This means that, while Rust's standard library provides a high-level API with powerful abstractions, the generated code should be just as fast and efficient as if the code were manually written with lower-level constructs.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Rust uses a combination of static analysis and code generation techniques, such as inlining, loop unrolling, and code specialization. For example, the Rust compiler may choose to inline a function call instead of generating code to jump to the function at runtime, thereby avoiding the overhead of a function call.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rust's ownership and borrowing system allows the compiler to optimize the generated code by eliminating unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, reducing runtime overhead and improving performance.</p>
<p>This approach allows Rust developers to write high-level code that is easy to read and maintain, while still achieving the performance and efficiency of low-level code. This makes Rust a popular choice for performance-critical applications, such as game engines, web browsers, and operating systems.</p>
<p>Overall, zero-cost abstractions are an important aspect of Rust's design, and they enable Rust to combine high-level abstractions with low-level performance, making it a powerful and efficient language for building complex and performance-critical systems.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<h2 id="zero-cost-abstractions-example"><a class="header" href="#zero-cost-abstractions-example">Zero-cost abstractions example</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of zero-cost abstrations:</p>
<pre><code>fn add&lt;T: std::ops::Add&lt;Output=T&gt;&gt;(x: T, y: T) -&gt; T {
    x + y
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    let z = add(x, y);
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, z);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>add</code> function takes two arguments of any type that implements the <code>Add</code> trait, adds them together using <code>+</code>, and returns the result. This function is generic, so it can be used with any type that implements <code>Add</code>, such as numbers, strings, or even custom objects.</p>
<p>Because the function is generic, it will be optimized by the Rust compiler to perform as efficiently as possible. This means that using the <code>add</code> function will not incur any additional runtime overhead, even though it uses an abstraction (the <code>Add</code> trait) to make the function more generic and reusable.</p>
<p>In this way, Rust demonstrates the concept of zero-cost abstraction, allowing developers to write modular, reusable code without sacrificing performance.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-cc"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-cc">Rust versus C/C++</a></h1>
<p>Rust and C/C++ are both systems programming languages that are designed to provide low-level control and high performance. However, there are some key differences between the two languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Memory safety: One of Rust's key features is its emphasis on memory safety. Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensure that memory is managed safely, preventing issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races. C and C++ do not have built-in memory safety features, making them more susceptible to these types of issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garbage collection: C and C++ rely on manual memory management, meaning that the programmer is responsible for allocating and freeing memory. Rust, on the other hand, uses a combination of static and dynamic memory management, and does not rely on garbage collection. This can make Rust code safer and more efficient, but may also require more careful management of memory in some cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax and readability: Rust has a syntax that is more similar to high-level programming languages than C and C++. Rust also includes many high-level features, such as pattern matching, closures, and iterators, which can make it easier to write readable and maintainable code. C and C++, on the other hand, have a more complex syntax and may require more low-level knowledge to write optimized code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency: Rust has strong support for concurrency, allowing developers to write safe and efficient concurrent code using features such as channels and locks. C and C++ also support concurrency, but require more manual management of threads and synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compilation speed: Rust's compilation speed is generally faster than that of C and C++, due to its modern compiler design and use of LLVM. However, C and C++ can still offer faster compilation times in some cases, particularly for large projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Rust provides memory safety and high-level features that make it easier to write safe and efficient code. C and C++ provide more low-level control and may be more suitable for certain types of projects, particularly those that require fine-grained control over hardware or performance. However, Rust's safety and concurrency features make it a strong contender for many systems programming tasks, particularly those that require safety and reliability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-go"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-go">Rust versus Go</a></h1>
<p>Rust and Go are both modern programming languages that have gained significant popularity in recent years, particularly in the context of system programming and network programming. Here are some key differences between the two:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance: Rust is generally considered to be a faster language than Go, as it compiles to native code and provides low-level control over memory management. Go, on the other hand, has a garbage collector and is designed to be a more high-level language, which can lead to slightly slower performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory safety: Rust's design places a heavy emphasis on memory safety, using a system of ownership and borrowing to prevent common memory-related errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows. Go also has some memory safety features, but they are less strict than Rust's.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency: Go was designed with concurrency in mind, and provides a powerful set of concurrency primitives like channels and goroutines that make it easy to write parallel code. Rust also has strong support for concurrency, but its concurrency model is based on ownership and borrowing, which can be more challenging for beginners to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax: Rust's syntax is generally considered to be more complex than Go's, with a steeper learning curve for beginners. Go's syntax is designed to be simple and easy to learn, which makes it a good choice for projects where many developers need to work together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ecosystem: Both Rust and Go have strong ecosystems, with a wide range of libraries and tools available for developers. Rust is particularly popular in the systems programming community, while Go is often used for network programming and web development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Rust is a more complex language with a greater emphasis on performance and memory safety, while Go is designed to be simpler and easier to learn, with a focus on concurrency and network programming.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-java"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-java">Rust versus Java</a></h1>
<p>Rust and Java are both high-level programming languages, but they have different design goals and are often used for different purposes. Here are some key differences between Rust and Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance: Rust is designed for high performance and low-level control, making it a good choice for systems programming tasks such as game engines, network programming, and operating system development. Java, on the other hand, is designed to provide a high-level of abstraction and is often used for enterprise software development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory management: Rust uses a unique ownership and borrowing system to manage memory, which prevents issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races. Java uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory, which can be more convenient for some types of applications but may introduce performance overhead and can be less predictable than manual memory management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency: Rust provides strong support for concurrency through features such as channels, locks, and async/await. Java also has good support for concurrency, but its implementation of threads and locks can sometimes lead to issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax and readability: Rust has a syntax that is similar to C and C++, and includes many high-level features such as pattern matching, closures, and iterators. Java has a syntax that is similar to C++, but is more verbose and includes more boilerplate code. Rust's syntax and features can make it easier to write readable and maintainable code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compilation and deployment: Rust code is typically compiled to machine code, which allows it to run more efficiently than Java's bytecode-based execution. However, Java's bytecode can be more portable and easier to deploy across multiple platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Rust and Java are both powerful programming languages, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. Rust is ideal for developing high-performance, memory-safe software, while Java is well-suited for developing enterprise applications and web services. The choice between Rust and Java ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the project and the preferences of the development team.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-javascript"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-javascript">Rust versus JavaScript</a></h1>

</li>
<li>
<p>Performance: Rust is generally faster than JavaScript, thanks to its low-level control and ability to optimize code for specific hardware platforms. JavaScript, on the other hand, relies on runtime optimizations to achieve good performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory management: Rust has a sophisticated system for managing memory that allows developers to write safe, low-level code without worrying about common memory-related bugs. JavaScript, on the other hand, relies on a garbage collector to automatically manage memory, which can lead to performance overhead and unpredictable behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases: Rust is often used for developing high-performance software, such as game engines, operating systems, or network servers. JavaScript is primarily used for developing web applications, secondarily for server-side programming, automation, or scripting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Rust and JavaScript are both powerful programming languages, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. Rust is ideal for developing high-performance, memory-safe software, while JavaScript is well-suited for building web applications and scripting.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-nim"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-nim">Rust versus Nim</a></h1>
<p>Rust and Nim are both programming languages that offer high performance and low-level control over hardware. However, they differ in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Syntax: Rust has a syntax that is similar to C++, while Nim has a more Python-like syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory management: Rust has a unique ownership model that ensures memory safety and eliminates many common bugs such as null pointer exceptions. In contrast, Nim uses garbage collection to manage memory, which can be less efficient but also easier to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency: Rust has built-in support for concurrency and parallelism through its ownership model and threading primitives, making it well-suited for high-performance, parallel applications. Nim also supports concurrency, but its implementation is based on async/await syntax, which is similar to other languages like Python and JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type system: Rust has a powerful and expressive type system that supports advanced features such as traits and generics. Nim also has a sophisticated type system that supports type inference and metaprogramming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community: Rust has a large and growing community, with many libraries and frameworks available for various use cases. Nim, on the other hand, has a smaller community but is still active and has a number of libraries.</p>
</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-python"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-python">Rust versus Python</a></h1>
<p>Rust and Python are two very different programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the key differences between Rust and Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance: Rust is a systems programming language designed for performance, while Python is an interpreted language optimized for ease of use and flexibility. Rust's static typing, memory safety, and zero-cost abstractions make it a good choice for writing high-performance, low-level code such as device drivers, game engines, and operating systems. Python, on the other hand, is often used for scripting, web development, and data science, where performance is less of a concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory management: Rust uses a unique ownership and borrowing system to manage memory, ensuring that memory-related bugs such as null pointer dereferences or use-after-free errors are caught at compile time rather than at runtime. Python, on the other hand, uses garbage collection to manage memory automatically, making it easier to write code but potentially slower and less memory-efficient than Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type system: Rust is a strongly typed language, with static type checking that ensures that variables are of the correct type at compile time. Python, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables can change type at runtime. While this makes Python more flexible and easier to use, it also increases the risk of type-related errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency: Rust has strong support for concurrency and parallelism, with features such as threads, async/await, and channels that allow developers to write high-performance, concurrent code. Python also has support for concurrency, but its implementation (using the Global Interpreter Lock) can limit performance in some cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Libraries and ecosystem: Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for a wide range of tasks, from web development to scientific computing to machine learning. Rust's ecosystem is smaller but growing, with many high-quality libraries and frameworks for systems programming, network programming, and game development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Rust and Python are two very different languages with different strengths and weaknesses. Rust is designed for performance and safety, with a strong focus on low-level systems programming, while Python is optimized for ease of use and flexibility, with a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for a wide range of tasks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-versus-zig"><a class="header" href="#rust-versus-zig">Rust versus Zig</a></h1>
<p>Rust and Zig are both modern programming languages that are designed to provide low-level control over hardware while still offering high-level abstractions. However, there are some key differences between the two.</p>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency. It was designed to be a replacement for C/C++ and is well-suited for writing high-performance, low-level code. Rust's syntax is somewhat similar to C/C++ but it includes several features that make it easier to write safe and concurrent code, such as ownership and borrowing, which help prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and data races.</p>
<p>Zig is also a systems programming language, but it has a different focus than Rust. Zig's main goals are to be simple, reliable, and efficient. It was designed to address some of the perceived shortcomings of C/C++ and aims to provide a more modern alternative. Zig's syntax is similar to C/C++ but it includes several features that make it easier to write safe and efficient code, such as compile-time memory management and error handling.</p>
<p>One of the key differences between Rust and Zig is their approach to memory management. Rust uses a system of ownership and borrowing to ensure memory safety, while Zig provides a more traditional manual memory management model. Rust's ownership system can make it easier to write safe code, but it can also be more complex to understand and use than Zig's manual memory management approach.</p>
<p>Another difference between Rust and Zig is their respective communities and ecosystems. Rust has a large and active community, with a wealth of libraries and tools available for use. Zig, on the other hand, is still a relatively new language and its ecosystem is still developing. However, Zig's simplicity and efficiency make it an attractive option for some developers, particularly those working on resource-constrained systems.</p>
<p>In summary, Rust and Zig are both modern systems programming languages that offer low-level control over hardware while still providing high-level abstractions. Rust emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency, while Zig focuses on simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. The choice between the two will depend on the specific requirements of a project and the preferences of the developer.</p>

<p>Linux drivers are software components that allow the Linux operating system to interact with and control hardware devices. They provide an interface between the hardware and the operating system, allowing applications and system services to communicate with the device.</p>
<p>Rust's key features make it a good fit for writing Linux drivers. For example, Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps prevent common errors such as null pointer dereferencing and data races. Rust also provides low-level control over memory management, making it easier to write efficient code that minimizes memory usage.</p>
<p>Rust's built-in concurrency features, including asynchronous programming support and zero-cost abstractions for multithreading, can be especially useful in driver development. These features enable developers to write highly performant, parallel code that takes advantage of modern hardware.</p>
<p>In addition, Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools that can help simplify driver development, including crates for working with hardware interfaces, such as I2C and SPI.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust's combination of safety, performance, and modern features make it an attractive choice for developing Linux drivers.</p>
<p>TODO: explain Linux adding Rust as a first-class language</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scalar-types"><a class="header" href="#scalar-types">Scalar types</a></h1>
<p>Rust has several scalar types that represent basic values and data structures. These types are built into the language and do not require any additional dependencies or libraries to use.</p>
<p>Boolean (bool): Represents a logical value, either true or false.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compound-types"><a class="header" href="#compound-types">Compound types</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a compound type is a type that is composed of other types. There are two main compound types in Rust: tuples and arrays.</p>
<p>Tuples: A tuple is an ordered list of elements of different types. Tuples in Rust are declared using parentheses and the elements are separated by commas. For example, the following code creates a tuple containing a string and an integer:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let my_tuple = (&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, 42);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We can access the individual elements of a tuple using indexing syntax:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let my_tuple = (&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, 42);
let my_string = my_tuple.0;
let my_int = my_tuple.1;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Arrays: An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Arrays in Rust are declared using square brackets and the elements are separated by commas. For example, the following code creates an array of integers with five elements:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We can access the individual elements of an array using indexing syntax:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let my_element = my_array[2]; // Access the third element
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Arrays in Rust have a fixed size, which means that they cannot be resized at runtime. However, Rust provides a more flexible compound type called a vector, which can be resized dynamically.</p>
<p>Compound types are useful for grouping related data together and passing them around as a single unit. They also allow for more complex data structures and algorithms to be created. By using tuples and arrays effectively, Rust developers can write more efficient and maintainable code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tuples-for-ordered-collections"><a class="header" href="#tuples-for-ordered-collections">Tuples for ordered collections</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a tuple is an ordered collection of values with a fixed length. Tuples can contain values of different types and are represented using parentheses with the values separated by commas.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a tuple containing two values, a string and an integer:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let person = (&quot;Alice&quot;, 30);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This defines a tuple called <code>person</code> containing the string &quot;Alice&quot; and the integer <code>30</code>. Tuples can be assigned to variables, passed as function arguments, and returned as function results, just like any other value in Rust.</p>
<p>You can access individual elements of a tuple using dot notation and the index of the element you want to access, starting from zero. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let name = person.0;
let age = person.1;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Tuples are often used to return multiple values from a function. For example, the <code>std::fs::metadata</code> function returns a result that is tuple, and contains information about a file or directory, such as its size and permissions:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::fs;

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let metadata = fs::metadata(&quot;file.txt&quot;)?; // get metadata for the file
    let (size, permissions) = (metadata.len(), metadata.permissions()); // extract to a tuple
    println!(&quot;File size is {} bytes, and permisisons are {}&quot;, size, permissions);
    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In summary, a tuple in Rust is an ordered collection of values with a fixed length. Tuples can contain values of different types and are represented using parentheses () with the values separated by commas.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="box-type-for-a-smart-pointer"><a class="header" href="#box-type-for-a-smart-pointer">Box type for a smart pointer</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a <code>Box</code> is a smart pointer that provides a way to allocate memory on the heap and move data into that memory. A <code>Box</code> is used when you need to allocate an object at runtime rather than at compile time, and want to ensure that the object is cleaned up automatically when it goes out of scope.</p>
<p>The <code>Box</code> type is defined in the Rust standard library and allocates memory on the heap for a value of a given type. When a value is wrapped in a <code>Box</code>, it is moved to the heap and the <code>Box</code> itself is stored on the stack. This allows you to allocate a large object on the heap without having to worry about stack size limitations.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of using <code>Box</code> is that it provides automatic memory management. When a <code>Box</code> goes out of scope, the memory it allocated is automatically deallocated. This eliminates the need to manually manage memory and helps prevent common memory-related bugs such as memory leaks and dangling pointers.</p>
<p>Another benefit of <code>Box</code> is that it enables ownership transfer. When you move a value into a <code>Box</code>, you transfer ownership of the value to the <code>Box</code>. This means that the <code>Box</code> becomes the owner of the value and is responsible for cleaning it up when it goes out of scope. This can be useful when you need to transfer ownership of a value between different parts of your program.</p>
<p>To use <code>Box</code>, you can create a new instance by calling the <code>Box::new</code> function and passing in the value you want to allocate on the heap. For example, to allocate a new <code>i32</code> value on the heap and store it in a <code>Box</code>, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let my_box = Box::new(42);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This creates a new <code>Box</code> that contains the value 42. When <code>my_box</code> goes out of scope, the memory it allocated will be automatically deallocated.</p>
<p>Overall, <code>Box</code> is a powerful tool for managing memory in Rust and can be used to allocate objects on the heap, transfer ownership between parts of your program, and prevent memory-related bugs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rc-type-for-single-thread-sharing"><a class="header" href="#rc-type-for-single-thread-sharing">Rc type for single-thread sharing</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, <code>Rc</code> (Reference Counted) is a smart pointer that provides shared ownership of a value. <code>Rc</code> works by keeping track of the number of references to a value, and ensuring that the value is not dropped until all references have been dropped. When a new reference to the value is created, <code>Rc</code> increments the reference count, and when a reference is dropped, <code>Rc</code> decrements the reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, <code>Rc</code> drops the value.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>Arc</code> smart pointer, <code>Rc</code> cannot be safely shared between threads and is used for single-threaded scenarios. When a new reference to the value is created, <code>Rc</code> increments the reference count, and when a reference is dropped, <code>Rc</code> decrements the reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, <code>Rc</code> drops the value.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let shared_data = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    let data1 = shared_data.clone();
    let data2 = shared_data.clone();

    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, shared_data);
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, data1);
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, data2);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, an <code>Rc</code> shares ownership of a vector between multiple references. The <code>Rc::new()</code> function creates a new <code>Rc</code> that points to a vector of [1, 2, 3]. The <code>clone()</code> method creates two new <code>Rc</code>s that point to the same vector, and the reference count is incremented. The <code>println!()</code> macro prints the values of each reference to the console.</p>
<p><code>Rc</code> is a useful tool for scenarios where shared ownership of a value is needed in a single-threaded environment. By using reference counting to manage the lifetime of the value, <code>Rc</code> ensures that the value is not dropped until all references to it have been dropped.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arc-type-for-multi-thread-sharing"><a class="header" href="#arc-type-for-multi-thread-sharing">Arc type for multi-thread sharing</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, <code>Arc</code> (Atomically Reference Counted) is a smart pointer that provides shared ownership of a value, similar to <code>Rc</code> (Reference Counted) smart pointer. The difference is that <code>Arc</code> can be safely shared between threads, for concurrent programming.</p>
<p><code>Arc</code> works by keeping track of the number of references to a value. When a new reference to the value is created, <code>Arc</code> increments the reference count, and when a reference is dropped, <code>Arc</code> decrements the reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, <code>Arc</code> drops the value.</p>
<p><code>Arc</code> provides a way to share ownership of a value between multiple threads, allowing multiple threads to access the value concurrently. When an <code>Arc</code> is cloned, a new pointer to the same value is created, and the reference count is incremented. Because <code>Arc</code> uses atomic operations to increment and decrement the reference count, it can be safely shared between threads.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let shared_data = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    for i in 0..3 {
        let data = shared_data.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let vec = data.iter().map(|x| x + i).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();
            println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, vec);
        });
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, an <code>Arc</code> shares ownership of a vector between multiple threads. The <code>Arc::new()</code> function creates a new <code>Arc</code> that points to a vector of <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>. The <code>clone()</code> method creates a new <code>Arc</code> that points to the same vector, and the reference count is incremented. The <code>thread::spawn()</code> function creates three threads, each of which iterates over the vector and adds the current loop index to each element. The results are collected into a new vector, which is printed to the console.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pin-type-for-memory-location"><a class="header" href="#pin-type-for-memory-location">Pin type for memory location</a></h1>
<p>Rust <code>Pin</code> type is a type that is used to express that a value should not be moved in memory. When an object is pinned, it means that its memory location cannot change, even if other parts of the program try to move it.</p>
<p>The <code>Pin</code> type is commonly used in Rust when dealing with data structures that hold references to other objects. In such cases, moving the data structure could invalidate the references, leading to undefined behavior.</p>
<p>To create a pinned object, you can use the <code>Pin::new</code> function, which takes a reference to the object and returns a <code>Pin</code> wrapper around it. This Pin wrapper can then be used to access the object, but it cannot be moved or dropped without first calling the unpin method on it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Rust provides a <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut T&gt;</code> type, which can be used to create a pinned reference to a mutable object. This allows you to modify the object through the reference while still ensuring that its memory location does not change.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust Pin <code>type</code> is an important tool for ensuring memory safety when dealing with complex data structures and references. It allows you to express the requirement that certain objects should not be moved in memory, which can help prevent bugs and ensure the correctness of your program.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<h2 id="pin-type-example"><a class="header" href="#pin-type-example">Pin type example</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of how to use Rust Pin type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::pin::Pin;

struct Data {
    value: i32,
}

impl Data {
    fn new(value: i32) -&gt; Self {
        Self { value }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let data = Data::new(42);
    let pinned_data = Pin::new(&amp;data);
    
    // Invalid move of `data`:
    // let moved_data = data;
    
    // Invalid move of `pinned_data`:
    // let moved_pinned_data = pinned_data;

    // We can access the value of `data` through `pinned_data`
    assert_eq!(42, pinned_data.value);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a Data struct that holds a single integer value. We then create a new instance of this struct, and use the <code>Pin::new</code> function to create a Pin wrapper around a reference to this instance.</p>
<p>Once <code>pinned_data</code> is created, attempting to move data will result in a compile-time error. Similarly, attempting to move <code>pinned_data</code> will also result in a compile-time error, because it is a wrapper around a pinned reference.</p>
<p>Despite being pinned, we can still access the value of data through <code>pinned_data</code>, as shown by the <code>assert_eq!</code> statement. This ensures that the reference remains valid, even if the data structure itself is moved.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="copy-trait-and-clone-trait-for-duplication"><a class="header" href="#copy-trait-and-clone-trait-for-duplication">Copy trait and Clone trait for duplication</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, the Copy trait controls how values are copied, while the Clone trait controls how values are cloned.</p>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait is used for types that can be safely copied bit-by-bit, without any special consideration for ownership or memory management. When a value with the <code>Copy</code> trait is assigned to a new variable or passed to a function, a bitwise copy of the original value is made. This means that the original value remains unchanged, and any changes made to the copied value do not affect the original.</p>
<p>Examples of types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait include simple scalar types like integers and booleans, as well as tuples and arrays that only contain types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait.</p>
<p>The <code>Clone trait</code>, on the other hand, is used for types that need to be explicitly cloned in order to make a copy. When a value with the <code>Clone</code> trait is cloned, a new instance of the value is created, and any owned data is also cloned. This means that changes made to the cloned value do not affect the original, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To implement the <code>Clone</code> trait for a type, you need to provide an implementation of the <code>clone</code> method, which creates a new instance of the type and clones any owned data. Rust also provides a default implementation of <code>Clone</code> for types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, which simply returns a bitwise copy of the value.</p>
<p>In summary, the <code>Copy</code> trait is used for types that can be copied bit-by-bit, while the <code>Clone</code> trait is used for types that need to be explicitly cloned in order to make a copy.</p>
<p>TODO: example</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="debug-trait-for-debugging-and-printing"><a class="header" href="#debug-trait-for-debugging-and-printing">Debug trait for debugging and printing</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, the <code>Debug</code> trait is a built-in trait that allows developers to print and debug Rust types. It provides a basic representation of a type suitable for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>When a type implements the <code>Debug</code> trait, it can be printed using the println! macro with the <code>{:?}</code> format specifier. This will print a debug representation of the type, which is often more informative than the default string representation.</p>
<p>To implement the <code>Debug</code> trait for a custom type, developers need to define a <code>debug</code> method on the type that returns a <code>fmt::Debug</code> trait object. This method should return a formatter that describes the structure of the type in a way that is suitable for debugging.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider a simple <code>Point</code> struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we have used the <code>derive</code> attribute to automatically generate an implementation of the <code>Debug</code> trait for our <code>Point</code> struct. This will create a <code>debug</code> method that returns a formatter that prints the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields of the struct.</p>
<p>With this implementation, we can use the <code>println!</code> macro to print a <code>Point</code> value like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let p = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
println!(&quot;Point: {:?}&quot;, p);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Point: Point { x: 10, y: 20 }
</code></pre>
<p>In summary, the <code>Debug</code> trait in Rust is a built-in trait that allows developers to print and debug Rust types. It provides a basic representation of a type suitable for debugging purposes and can be implemented for custom types by defining a debug method that returns a formatter.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="display-trait-for-formatting"><a class="header" href="#display-trait-for-formatting">Display trait for formatting</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, the <code>Display</code> trait is a built-in trait that allows developers to format a value as a string for display purposes. It provides a human-readable representation of a type.</p>
<p>When a type implements the <code>Display</code> trait, it can be formatted as a string using the <code>format!</code> macro or the <code>println!</code> macro with the <code>{}</code> format specifier. This will use the <code>Display</code> implementation to convert the value into a string that can be displayed.</p>
<p>To implement the <code>Display</code> trait for a custom type, we define a <code>fmt</code> method on the type that takes a formatter object. The formatter object implements the <code>fmt::Write</code> trait, which provides methods for writing to a string buffer.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider a simple Point struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::fmt;

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl fmt::Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        write!(f, &quot;({}, {})&quot;, self.x, self.y)
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we define a <code>fmt</code> method for the <code>Display</code> trait on our <code>Point</code> struct. This method takes a formatter object and formats the <code>x</code> field and <code>y</code> field of the struct into a string that is suitable for display. We use the <code>write!</code> macro to write the fields into the formatter object.</p>
<p>With this implementation, we can use the <code>format!</code> macro to format a Point value as a string like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let p = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
let s = format!(&quot;Point: {}&quot;, p); // The result is &quot;Point: (10, 20)&quot;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In summary, the <code>Display</code> trait in Rust is a built-in trait that allows developers to format a value as a string for display purposes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dyn-trait-for-dynamic-dispatch"><a class="header" href="#dyn-trait-for-dynamic-dispatch">dyn trait for dynamic dispatch</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a <code>dyn trait</code> is a way to specify a trait object with dynamic dispatch.</p>
<p>A <code>trait</code> object is a pointer to an object that implements a trait, and is used when the concrete type of an object is not known at compile time. In other words, it allows you to write code that can work with different types that implement a particular trait without knowing the exact type at compile time.</p>
<p>When defining a <code>trait</code> object in Rust, you can use the <code>dyn</code> keyword to indicate that the trait object should be dynamically dispatched. This means that the specific implementation of the trait for a given object will be determined at runtime rather than at compile time.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following trait definition:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait MyTrait {
    fn my_method(&amp;self);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To define a trait object with dynamic dispatch, you can use the dyn keyword as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn my_function(obj: &amp;dyn MyTrait) {
    obj.my_method();
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>my_function</code> takes a reference to a trait object that implements the <code>MyTrait</code> trait, with dynamic dispatch specified using the <code>dyn</code> keyword. This means that at runtime, the specific implementation of <code>my_method</code> for the given object will be determined dynamically.</p>
<p>Using <code>dyn trait</code> allows Rust to provide runtime polymorphism, which is useful in situations where the concrete type of an object is not known at compile time, but needs to be determined at runtime. However, it can come at a performance cost compared to static dispatch, which is resolved at compile time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="eq-partialeq-ord-partialord-hash-traits"><a class="header" href="#eq-partialeq-ord-partialord-hash-traits">Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Hash traits</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, traits are used to define shared behavior for types. The following are commonly used traits for comparing and hashing types in Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eq trait: This trait defines the equality relation between two values of a given type. The Eq trait requires that the type implements the PartialEq trait, which defines the partial equality relation. If two values of a type are equal according to the Eq trait, they must be considered indistinguishable in every way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PartialEq trait: This trait defines the partial equality relation between two values of a given type. The PartialEq trait requires that the type implements an eq method that takes another value of the same type as an argument, and returns a bool indicating whether the two values are equal. If two values of a type are equal according to the PartialEq trait, they must be considered indistinguishable for the purposes of the Eq trait as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ord trait: This trait defines the total order relation between two values of a given type. The Ord trait requires that the type implements the PartialOrd trait, which defines the partial order relation. If two values of a type are compared using the Ord trait, they must be completely ordered in a consistent way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PartialOrd trait: This trait defines the partial order relation between two values of a given type. The PartialOrd trait requires that the type implements a partial_cmp method that takes another value of the same type as an argument, and returns an Option<Ordering> indicating the ordering relationship between the two values. If two values of a type are compared using the PartialOrd trait, they must be partially ordered in a consistent way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hash trait: This trait defines the hash value of a value of a given type. The Hash trait requires that the type implements a hash method that returns a hash value of type u64. Hash values should be consistent and uniform, so that two values that are equal according to the Eq trait produce the same hash value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These traits are important for comparing and hashing types in Rust, and are used extensively in Rust's standard library.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="from-and-into-traits-for-conversions"><a class="header" href="#from-and-into-traits-for-conversions">From and Into traits for conversions</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, the <code>From</code> trait and <code>Into</code> trait are used to convert values between different types. The <code>From</code> trait allows developers to define how a type can be constructed from another type, and the <code>Into</code> trait allows developers to define how a type can be converted into another type.</p>
<p>The <code>From</code> trait is implemented for a type and provides a <code>from</code> method that takes an argument of a different type and returns an instance of the implementing type. This allows for easy conversion between different types, especially when converting from a type that is not owned by the implementing type.</p>
<p>The <code>Into</code> trait is the opposite of the <code>From</code> trait, and is implemented for a type and provides an into method that takes no arguments and returns an instance of a different type. This allows for easy conversion between different types, especially when converting from a type that is owned by the implementing type.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct MyInt(i32);

impl From&lt;i32&gt; for MyInt {
    fn from(val: i32) -&gt; Self {
        MyInt(val)
    }
}

impl Into&lt;i32&gt; for MyInt {
    fn into(self) -&gt; i32 {
        self.0
    }
}

let my_int = MyInt::from(42);
let i = my_int.into();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This example defines a simple <code>MyInt</code> struct. We implement the <code>From</code> trait for it, and define a <code>from</code> method that takes an <code>i32</code> value and returns a <code>MyInt</code> instance; this allows us to convert from an <code>i32</code> value into a <code>MyInt</code> instance, by using the <code>from</code> method. We implement the <code>Into</code> trait for it, and define an <code>into</code> method that takes no arguments and returns an <code>i32</code> value; this allows us to convert a <code>MyInt</code> instance into an <code>i32</code> value, by using the <code>into</code> method. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="send-and-sync-traits-for-multithreading"><a class="header" href="#send-and-sync-traits-for-multithreading">Send and Sync traits for multithreading</a></h1>
<p>Rust provides two important traits that are related to concurrency and multithreading: <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Send</code> trait in Rust indicates that a type is safe to be sent across thread boundaries. This means that if a type implements the <code>Send</code> trait, it can be safely passed from one thread to another without causing any data races or undefined behavior. For example, the <code>String</code> type in Rust implements the <code>Send</code> trait, which means it can be safely shared across multiple threads.</p>
<p>To implement the <code>Send</code> trait for a custom type, all of its fields must also implement the <code>Send</code> trait. This is because if a type contains non-<code>Send</code> fields, it may be possible for data races to occur when the type is shared across threads. The <code>Send</code> trait is automatically implemented for most primitive types in Rust, as well as many standard library types like <code>Vec</code> and <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>To summarize, the Send trait ensures that a type can be safely transferred between threads, while the Sync trait ensures that a type can be safely shared between threads. These traits are important for writing safe and efficient concurrent Rust code.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<h2 id="send-trait-details"><a class="header" href="#send-trait-details">Send trait details</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of a custom type that implements the <code>Send</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Foo {
    x: i32,
    y: String,
}

unsafe impl Send for Foo {}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo { x: 42, y: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.to_string() };
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        println!(&quot;x = {}, y = {}&quot;, foo.x, foo.y);
    });
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>Foo</code> struct contains an <code>i32</code> field and a <code>String</code> field. Since both <code>i32</code> and <code>String</code> implement the <code>Send</code> trait, we can manually implement <code>Send</code> for <code>Foo</code> using the <code>unsafe impl Send for Foo {}</code> syntax. We can then safely pass a <code>Foo</code> instance to a new thread using <code>std::thread::spawn</code>, and access its fields from within the thread without causing any data races.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 id="sync-trait-details"><a class="header" href="#sync-trait-details">Sync trait details</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Sync</code> trait in Rust indicates that a type is safe to be shared between multiple threads. This means that if a type implements the <code>Sync</code> trait, it can be safely accessed from multiple threads without causing any data races or undefined behavior. For example, the <code>Arc</code> type in Rust implements the <code>Sync</code> trait, which means it can be safely shared between multiple threads.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how the Sync trait can be used:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::sync::Arc;

struct MyStruct {
    // ...
}

impl MyStruct {
    fn do_something(&amp;self) {
        // ...
    }
}

// Create a shared instance of MyStruct that can be safely accessed from multiple threads
let shared = Arc::new(MyStruct { /* ... */ });

// Spawn a new thread that will use the shared instance
std::thread::spawn({
    let shared = shared.clone();
    move || {
        shared.do_something();
    }
});
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we create a shared instance of <code>MyStruct</code> using the <code>Arc</code> type, which automatically implements the <code>Sync</code> trait. We can then safely access the shared instance from multiple threads, without worrying about synchronization issues.</p>
<p>The <code>Sync</code> trait is automatically implemented for any type that satisfies the following conditions: the type is <code>Send</code>, which means that it can be safely moved between threads, and the type does not have any interior mutability, which means that there are no mutable references to the type's contents.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="asyncawait-keywords-for-asynchronicity"><a class="header" href="#asyncawait-keywords-for-asynchronicity">async/await keywords for asynchronicity</a></h1>
<p>Rust provides support for asynchronous programming through its <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax. The <code>async</code> keyword defines a function that can be suspended and resumed later, while the <code>await</code> keyword pauses execution of an <code>async</code> function until a condition is met.</p>
<p>When a function is declared with the <code>async</code> keyword, it becomes an asynchronous function. This means that the function can be paused at any point using the await keyword and resumed later when the awaited value becomes available. The async function returns a <code>Future</code> type that represents the result of the computation.</p>
<p>Here's an example of an async function that returns a future:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn fetch_url(url: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    Ok(body)
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>fetch_url</code> function is defined with the <code>async</code> keyword. It uses the <code>reqwest</code> crate to make an HTTP request. The <code>await</code> keyword is used twice to pause the execution of the function until the response is received and the body is retrieved.</p>
<p>The <code>await</code> keyword pauses the execution of an <code>async</code> function until a condition is met. It can be used with any value that implements the <code>Future</code> trait. When <code>await</code> is used with a future, it suspends the current task, waits for the future to complete, then returns the result.</p>
<p>Here's an example of using the await keyword to wait for a future:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn do_something() -&gt; i32 {
    let future = get_result_async();
    let result = await!(future);
    result + 1
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>await</code> keyword pauses execution of the <code>do_something</code> function until <code>get_result_async</code> is completed. Once the future completes, the result is returned and the task is resumed. The value of the result is then incremented by 1 and returned as the final result.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="enum-keyword-for-enumerations"><a class="header" href="#enum-keyword-for-enumerations">enum keyword for enumerations</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, an enum (short for &quot;enumeration&quot;) is a custom data type that allows you to define a set of named values. Each value is called a variant, and you can use an enum to represent a fixed set of possible values for a particular data type.</p>
<p>Here's an example of an enum in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we've defined an enum called <code>Color</code> with three variants: <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, and <code>Blue</code>. We can use this enum to represent a color value in our Rust program.</p>
<p>Enums in Rust can also include data associated with each variant. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum IPAddress {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we've defined an enum called <code>IPAddress</code> with two variants: <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>. The <code>V4</code> variant includes four <code>u8</code> values representing the four octets of an IPv4 address, while the V6 variant includes a single <code>String</code> value representing an IPv6 address.</p>
<p>Enums in Rust can be useful for a variety of programming tasks, including defining states for a state machine, representing different types of errors, and creating custom data types for your program. Rust's enums are type-safe and flexible, making them a powerful tool for Rust programmers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="match-keyword-for-control-flow"><a class="header" href="#match-keyword-for-control-flow">Match keyword for control flow</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, the <code>match</code> keyword is a powerful control flow construct that allows a program to match a value against a set of patterns and execute code based on the match result. The <code>match</code> keyword and statement is similar to a <code>switch</code> keyword and statement in other languages, but <code>match</code> provides more powerful pattern matching capabilities.</p>
<p>A match statement typically has the following syntax:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>match &lt;value&gt; {
    &lt;pattern_1&gt; =&gt; &lt;code_1&gt;,
    &lt;pattern_2&gt; =&gt; &lt;code_2&gt;,
    ...
    &lt;pattern_n&gt; =&gt; &lt;code_n&gt;,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> is the expression that is being matched against, and the <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> expressions are the patterns that are being matched. Each <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> is followed by a <code>=&gt;</code> symbol, then a block of code that will be executed if the pattern matches the value.</p>
<p>In Rust, a pattern can take many forms, including literal values (e.g. <code>42</code>, &quot;hello&quot;), variables (e.g. <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>), wldcards (e.g. <code>_</code>), ranges (e.g. <code>1..=5</code>), enums (e.g. <code>Some(value)</code>), structs (e.g. <code>Point { x, y }</code>), tuples (e.g. <code>(x, y)</code>), and more.</p>
<p>The code in each match arm is executed if the pattern on the left-hand side of the <code>=&gt;</code> operator matches the value being matched. If none of the patterns match, the <code>match</code> statement will panic at runtime.</p>
<p>Rust's <code>match</code> statements are powerful and flexible, allowing for complex patterns and expressions to be matched. Match statements are commonly used in Rust to handle errors, parse command-line arguments, and implement state machines, among other use cases.</p>
<p>Overall, match statements are a key feature of Rust's control flow syntax, and provide a powerful mechanism for pattern matching and value extraction in Rust programs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mod-keyword-for-module-namespaces"><a class="header" href="#mod-keyword-for-module-namespaces">mod keyword for module namespaces</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, namespaces are a way to organize and group related items, such as functions, types, and constants, under a common name. Namespaces are implemented using modules, which are Rust's primary mechanism for organizing code into reusable components.</p>
<p>Modules can be defined using the <code>mod</code> keyword, followed by the name of the module and its contents enclosed in curly braces:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>mod my_module {
    fn private_function() {
        // implementation details here
    }
    pub fn public_function() {
        // implementation details here
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>my_module</code> is a module that contains two functions: <code>private_function</code>, which is not visible outside of the module, and <code>public_function</code>, which is marked as pub and can be accessed from other modules.</p>
<p>To use a module from another module, you can use the use keyword to bring its contents into scope:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use my_module::public_function;

fn main() {
    public_function();
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we bring the <code>public_function</code> from <code>my_module</code> into the scope of main, allowing us to call it directly.</p>
<p>Overall, namespaces in Rust provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and structuring code, enabling developers to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable software.</p>
<h2 id="hierarchical-modules"><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-modules">Hierarchical modules</a></h2>
<p>Rust also provides a hierarchical module system, where modules can be nested within other modules to create a hierarchy of namespaces:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>mod outer_module {
    mod inner_module {
        fn private_function() {
            // implementation details here
        }
        pub fn public_function() {
            // implementation details here
        }
    }
    use inner_module::public_function;
    pub fn call_public_function() {
        public_function();
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>inner_module</code> is nested within <code>outer_module</code>, creating a hierarchy of namespaces. We can use the <code>use</code> keyword to bring <code>public_function</code> into scope, and then call it from <code>call_public_function</code>.</p>
<p>Overall, heirarchical modules in Rust provide ways for organizing and structuring code, by using nested namespaces.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="struct-keyword-for-custom-data-types"><a class="header" href="#struct-keyword-for-custom-data-types">struct keyword for custom data types</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a struct is a custom data type that allows you to group together related data items and functions that operate on that data. A struct can be defined using the <code>struct</code> keyword, followed by the name of the struct and a block of curly braces that contains the fields of the struct.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a struct definition in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a struct named <code>Rectangle</code> that has two fields: <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, both unsigned 32-bit integer types.</p>
<p>Structs can also have functions associated with them, called methods. Methods are defined within the block of curly braces after the fields of the struct, and can be used to operate on the data within the struct. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This example uses <code>impl</code> to define an implementation block for the <code>Rectangle</code> struct, and defines a method named <code>area</code> that calculates the area of the rectangle. The <code>&amp;self</code> parameter indicates that the method takes a reference to the struct as its first argument.</p>
<p>Once a struct is defined, you can create instances of the struct by calling its constructor function, which is the name of the struct followed by <code>::new</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let r = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This creates a new <code>Rectangle</code> struct with a <code>width</code> field of 10, and an <code>height</code> field of 20.</p>
<p>Overall, structs in Rust provide ways to define custom data types with associated functions and methods, making it easy to organize and manipulate complex data structures.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trait-keyword-for-polymorphism"><a class="header" href="#trait-keyword-for-polymorphism">Trait keyword for polymorphism</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a trait is a language construct that defines a set of methods that can be implemented by a type. Traits allow Rust to achieve polymorphism and code reuse without sacrificing performance or safety.</p>
<p>A trait is defined using the <code>trait</code> keyword, followed by the name of the trait and a list of method signatures:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait MyTrait {
    fn method1(&amp;self);
    fn method2(&amp;mut self, value: i32) -&gt; i32;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This defines a trait called <code>MyTrait</code> with two methods, <code>method1</code> and <code>method2</code>. The methods have different signatures and can have different behavior for each type that implements the trait.</p>
<p>To implement a trait for a type, you use the <code>impl</code> keyword followed by the trait name and the implementation block:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct MyStruct;

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn method1(&amp;self) {
        println!(&quot;Hello from method1!&quot;);
    }
    fn method2(&amp;mut self, value: i32) -&gt; i32 {
        value * 2
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This defines an implementation of <code>MyTrait</code> for the <code>MyStruct</code> type. The <code>method1</code> method simply prints a message to the console, while <code>method2</code> takes a mutable reference to self and returns the input value multiplied by two.</p>
<p>Once a trait is implemented for a type, any function that takes the trait as a parameter can use the implemented methods:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn use_trait&lt;T: MyTrait&gt;(item: &amp;mut T) {
    item.method1();
    let result = item.method2(10);
    println!(&quot;method2 returned {}&quot;, result);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This function takes a mutable reference to any type that implements <code>MyTrait</code>, calls <code>method1</code> and <code>method2</code> on it, and prints the result of <code>method2</code> to the console.</p>
<p>Traits can also be used for generic programming and code reuse. For example, Rust's standard library defines many traits, such as Iterator, Clone, and Debug, that can be implemented by custom types to provide functionality that's common across many different types.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="catch_unwind-macro-to-handle-panic"><a class="header" href="#catch_unwind-macro-to-handle-panic">catch_unwind! macro to handle panic</a></h1>
<p>The Rust <code>panic</code> <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro is a way to catch unwinding panics that can occur when a piece of code fails at runtime. When an unwinding panic happens, Rust unwinds the stack and calls the panic handler, which can be customized to do any number of things, such as print an error message or roll back a transaction.</p>
<p>The <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro allows you to catch these unwinding panics and handle them in a more controlled way. It returns a Result value that lets you know if the code in the block panicked or not. If it did panic, you can then handle the error in any way you see fit, such as printing an error message or returning an alternate value.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to use the <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::panic;

let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
    // Code that might panic goes here
});

match result {
    Ok(_) =&gt; println!(&quot;Code did not panic&quot;),
    Err(_) =&gt; println!(&quot;Code panicked!&quot;),
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a closure that contains the code we want to run. We then pass that closure to the <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro. If the code within the closure panics, the result value will be an <code>Err</code> value. If it doesn't panic, the result value will be an <code>Ok</code> value.</p>
<p>The <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro is not guaranteed to succeed, for example when using custom panics or aborting panics. Additionally, the <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro is not generally recommended outside of FFI purposes. To help prevent panics, Rust provides many non-panic functions, such as Vec <code>get</code> instead of slice, and <code>checked_add</code> instead of operator addition. To help documentation show panics, Rust Clippy provides the lint <code>missing_panics_doc</code>.</p>
<p>Overall, the <code>catch_unwind!</code> macro is a powerful way to handle panics and ensure that your Rust code remains stable and reliable even in the face of unexpected errors.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="macro_rules-for-declarative-macros"><a class="header" href="#macro_rules-for-declarative-macros">macro_rules! for declarative macros</a></h1>
<p>The Rust <code>macro_rules!</code> macro is a powerful code generation tool that allows the developer to create custom syntax or keywords that expand into Rust code at compile time. With this macro, you can define custom syntax rules, patterns, and templates that can be used to generate code automatically.</p>
<p>The <code>macro_rules!</code> macro works by defining a set of rules that match the input code, similar to a regular expression. These rules are then used to generate Rust code based on the input, which can be used to reduce the amount of repetitive or boilerplate code required for a given codebase.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>macro_rules! my_macro_name { 
  // Define patterns and templates here that match the input code 
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here's an example of a simple Rust macro that generates a for loop with a range of numbers:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[macro_export]
macro_rules! number_loop {
    ($start:expr, $end:expr) =&gt; {
        for i in $start..$end {
            println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i);
        }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>With this macro, you can now generate a for loop by simply invoking the number_loop! macro with the desired start and end values as arguments:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>number_loop!(0, 10);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This will output the numbers from 0 to 9, as defined by the macro's for loop. </p>
<p>In summary, the Rust <code>macro_rules!</code> macro is a powerful code generation tool that enables developers to generate custom syntax and templates to automate repetitive tasks in their codebase.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="annotations-for-compiler-directives"><a class="header" href="#annotations-for-compiler-directives">Annotations for compiler directives</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, annotations are used to provide additional information to the compiler about how code should be compiled or optimized. Annotations are usually written as attributes and are placed above the item they apply to.</p>
<p>There are different types of annotations in Rust, such as <code>derive</code>, <code>allow</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>inline</code>, <code>cfg</code>, and more.</p>
<p><code>#[derive]</code>: automatically implement certain traits for a struct or enum, such as Debug or Clone. For example, if you want to automatically implement the Debug trait for a struct named Person, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>#[allow]</code>: allow behaviors that the compiler would otherwise flag with specific compiler warnings. For example, if you want to silence warnings about unused variables, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

    let x = 42;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>#[test]</code> annotation: mark a function as a test. Rust has built-in support for unit testing, and functions marked with #[test] will be run as part of the test suite. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[test]
fn test_addition() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>#[inline]</code> annotation: suggest to the compiler that a function should be inlined at the call site for performance reasons. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[inline]
fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    x + y
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>#[cfg]</code> annotation: conditionally compile code based on certain conditions, such as the target platform or build configuration. For example, if you want to compile certain code only when the target platform is Windows, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[cfg(target_os = &quot;windows&quot;)]
fn windows_only_function() {
    // ...
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Overall, annotations in Rust provide a way to add additional information to code that can help the compiler optimize and generate better code. They are a powerful tool for controlling the behavior of the compiler and improving the performance of Rust programs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="destructuring-into-components"><a class="header" href="#destructuring-into-components">Destructuring into components</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, destructuring is the process of taking apart a complex data structure (such as a tuple, struct, or enum) into its individual components, which can then be used separately in code.</p>
<p>Destructuring is often used in pattern matching, which allows you to match a value against a pattern and extract the relevant parts of the value. For example, consider the following tuple:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let my_tuple = (1, 2);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You can use destructuring to extract the individual elements of the tuple like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let (a, b) = my_tuple;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, <code>a</code> will be assigned the value 1, and <code>b</code> will be assigned the value 2.</p>
<p>Destructuring can also be used with structs, where you can destructure the fields of a struct like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct MyStruct {
    field1: i32,
    field2: String,
}

let my_struct = MyStruct { field1: 42, field2: String::from(&quot;hello&quot;) };

let MyStruct { value1, value2 } = my_struct;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This will assign the value of <code>field1</code> to a variable named <code>value1</code> and the value of <code>field2</code> to a variable named <code>value2</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to tuples and structs, Rust's enums can also be destructured using pattern matching. You can match on the enum's variants and extract their associated data like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum MyEnum {
    Variant1(i32),
    Variant2(String),
}

let my_enum = MyEnum::Variant1(42);

match my_enum {
    MyEnum::Variant1(n) =&gt; println!(&quot;Got a number: {}&quot;, n),
    MyEnum::Variant2(s) =&gt; println!(&quot;Got a string: {}&quot;, s),
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>n</code> will be assigned the value of the integer passed to the <code>Variant1</code> variant, and <code>s</code> will be assigned the value of the string passed to the <code>Variant2</code> variant.</p>
<p>Overall, destructuring is a powerful tool in Rust that allows you to easily extract data from complex data structures using pattern matching.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="iterators-for-traversing-collections"><a class="header" href="#iterators-for-traversing-collections">Iterators for traversing collections</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, iterators are abstractions for traversing collections of data, such as arrays, vectors, and other sequences. Iterators access the elements of a collection, and can be used with many of Rust's built-in language features, such as loops and closures.</p>
<p>Iterators in Rust are defined by the <code>Iterator</code> trait, which provides methods for traversing and manipulating a sequence of elements. Some common methods on iterators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>next()</code>: Returns the next iterator element, or None if there are no more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>map()</code>: Transforms each element of the iterator by applying a closure to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>filter()</code>: Returns a new iterator that includes only the elements that match a given predicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fold()</code>: Reduces the iterator elements into a single value, by repeatedly applying a given function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of using an iterator to traverse a vector and sum up its elements:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = v.iter().fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);
println!(&quot;The sum is: {}&quot;, sum);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we create a vector <code>v</code> and use the <code>iter()</code> method to create an iterator over its elements. We then use the <code>fold()</code> method to iterate over the elements, and accumule the sum of all the elements in the vector.</p>
<p>Iterators can also be used in loops, as in the following example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for i in v.iter().map(|x| x * 2) {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we create an iterator over the elements of the vector, and use the <code>map()</code> method to transform each element by doubling it. We then use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over the transformed elements, and print them out one by one.</p>
<p>Overall, iterators are a powerful and flexible abstraction for working with collections of data in Rust, and are widely used throughout the language.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="closures-for-anonymous-functions"><a class="header" href="#closures-for-anonymous-functions">Closures for anonymous functions</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, closures are a type of anonymous function that can capture variables from their surrounding environment. This makes closures a powerful tool for writing functional-style code, as they allow you to create self-contained units of behavior that can be passed around and reused.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a simple closure in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let add = |a, b| a + b;
let result = add(3, 4);
println!(&quot;Result is {}&quot;, result);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a closure add that takes two arguments <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and returns their sum. We then call the closure with arguments <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> and print the result.</p>
<p>Closures in Rust are defined using the <code>|</code> symbol to specify the arguments, followed by the closure body enclosed in braces <code>{}</code>. Rust's type inference system allows you to omit the types of the arguments, as long as they can be inferred from the context.</p>
<p>One important feature of Rust closures is that they can capture variables from their surrounding environment. This means that a closure can access variables that are defined outside of it, even after the original function that created the closure has returned. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let add_x = |y| x + y;
    let result = add_x(3);
    println!(&quot;Result is {}&quot;, result);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a closure <code>add_x</code> that takes an argument <code>y</code> and adds it to the variable <code>x</code> that is already defined outside of the closure. When we call the closure with argument <code>3</code>, it captures the value of <code>x</code> and returns <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>Rust closures can also be used to create iterators, which are a powerful tool for working with collections of data. For example, the map method on a Vec can be used to apply a closure to each element of the vector:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
let squares = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * x);
for square in squares {
    println!(&quot;Square is {}&quot;, square);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a vector of numbers, then use the <code>iter</code> method to create an iterator over the vector's elements. We then use the <code>map</code> method to apply a closure that squares each element of the vector. Finally, we loop over the resulting iterator and print each square.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust closures are a powerful feature that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from simple arithmetic to complex functional programming.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="macros-for-metaprogramming"><a class="header" href="#macros-for-metaprogramming">Macros for metaprogramming</a></h1>
<p>Rust macros are a powerful tool for metaprogramming, allowing you to write code that generates code at compile-time. Macros are defined using the macro_rules! macro, which allows you to match on patterns in the code and generate new code based on those patterns.</p>
<p>Rust macros can be used for a variety of tasks, such as creating domain-specific languages (DSLs), reducing boilerplate code, or implementing code generation tools.</p>
<p>There are two types of Rust macros: declarative macros and procedural macros.</p>
<p>Declarative macros (also known as &quot;macro_rules! macros&quot;) use pattern matching to transform code. They are defined using the <code>macro_rules!</code> macro and operate on the tokens that make up the code. Declarative macros can be used to create new syntax or simplify existing syntax, and they are often used to create DSLs.</p>
<p>Procedural macros, on the other hand, operate on the AST (abstract syntax tree) of the code. They are defined using Rust's proc_macro API and allow you to write code that generates new code at compile-time. Procedural macros can be used to implement custom derive macros, attribute macros, and function-like macros.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust macros provide a powerful mechanism for metaprogramming, allowing you to write code that generates code at compile-time. Whether you need to create DSLs, reduce boilerplate code, or implement code generation tools, Rust macros provide a flexible and expressive way to accomplish these tasks.</p>
<p>Example of a declarative macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>macro_rules! greet {
    (to $name:ident) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;, stringify!($name));
    };
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This macro takes a value, in this case <code>name</code>, and generates a custom greeting message for it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="panic-and-how-to-handle-it-with-a-hook"><a class="header" href="#panic-and-how-to-handle-it-with-a-hook">Panic and how to handle it with a hook</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a <code>panic</code> occurs when a program encounters a situation where it cannot continue to run safely. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a failed assertion, an out-of-bounds array access, or an attempt to unwrap a <code>None</code> value. When a <code>panic</code> occurs, Rust will unwind the stack and search for a <code>catch_unwind</code> block that can handle the panic. If no such block is found, the program will terminate with an error message.</p>
<p>By default, Rust will print an error message and terminate the program when a panic occurs. However, it is possible to customize this behavior by adding a <code>panic</code> hook. This allows you to define your own <code>panic</code> handler that can log the error, send an alert, or perform other actions before terminating the program.</p>
<p>You can define a <code>panic</code> hook by calling the <code>std::panic::set_hook</code> function and passing a closure that takes a <code>PanicInfo</code> struct as an argument. This struct contains information about the panic, such as the file and line where it occurred and the message associated with the panic.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a panic hook that logs the message then terminates the program:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::panic;

fn main() {
    panic::set_hook(Box::new(|panic_info| {
        let message = panic_info
            .payload()
            .downcast_ref::&lt;String&gt;()
            .unwrap_or(&amp;&quot;Unknown error&quot;.to_string());
        eprintln!(&quot;Panic occurred: {}&quot;, message);
    }));

    // Trigger a panic
    panic!(&quot;Something went wrong!&quot;);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This sets a <code>panic</code> hook that logs the <code>panic</code> message to the standard error stream using the <code>eprintln</code> macro. When the program encounters a <code>panic!</code> macro, it will trigger the panic hook and log the error message before terminating the program.</p>
<p>In general, avoid panics when possible and handle errors gracefully using Rust's <code>Result</code> type. However, in some cases, panics may be the appropriate way to handle errors.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="range-syntax-for-a-sequence-of-values"><a class="header" href="#range-syntax-for-a-sequence-of-values">Range syntax for a sequence of values</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, a range is a way to represent a sequence of values between a start and end point. A range are defined using the syntax <code>start..end</code>, where <code>start</code> is the first value in the range, and <code>end</code> is the first value not in the range.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of Rust ranges:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = 0..10;  // range from 0 to 9 inclusive
let b = 1..=10; // range from 1 to 10 inclusive
let c = ..5;    // range from the start up to (but not including) 5
let d = 5..;    // range from 5 to infinity
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Ranges can be used in many contexts in Rust, such as in for loops:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>for i in 0..10 {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This will print the numbers from 0 to 9.</p>
<p>Ranges can also be used with various methods provided by the <code>Iterator</code> trait, such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>fold</code>, and more:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let nums = (0..10).filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).map(|x| x * 2).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();
// nums is now [0, 4, 8, 12, 16]
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This creates a range from 0 to 9, filters out any odd numbers, doubles the remaining even numbers, and collects them into a vector.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust ranges are a flexible and convenient way to represent sequences of values, and they are widely used throughout the language.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#memory-lifetimes">Memory lifetimes</a></h1>
<p>Rust is a programming language that aims to provide high performance, memory safety, and data concurrency. One of the ways Rust achieves memory safety is by enforcing strict rules for memory management, which includes the concept of memory lifetimes.</p>
<p>Memory lifetimes in Rust refer to the duration for which a particular piece of memory is valid and can be accessed. Rust uses a borrow checker to enforce rules around memory lifetimes and ensure that memory is accessed safely and without any undefined behavior.</p>
<p>In Rust, memory lifetimes are determined by the ownership and borrowing system. Every value in Rust has an owner, which is responsible for allocating and freeing the memory associated with the value. When a value is borrowed, the borrower is given a reference to the memory owned by the owner. The borrower must return the reference before the owner goes out of scope, or else the program will not compile.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &amp;x;
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, y);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>x</code> is an integer with a value of 5. The <code>&amp;</code> operator creates a reference to <code>x</code> and assign it to <code>y</code>. The <code>println!()</code> macro prints the value of <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>In this code, the lifetime of <code>x</code> begins when it is created and ends when it goes out of scope at the end of the <code>main()</code> function. The lifetime of <code>y</code> is the same as the lifetime of <code>x</code>, because it is a reference to the memory owned by <code>x</code>. The borrow checker ensures that <code>y</code> is returned before <code>x</code> goes out of scope.</p>
<p>Rust's memory lifetimes can be complex, but they help ensure that programs are safe and free from undefined behavior. By enforcing strict rules around memory management, Rust makes it possible to write high-performance, memory-safe code without the need for garbage collection or other runtime memory management.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory-on-the-stack-or-the-heap"><a class="header" href="#memory-on-the-stack-or-the-heap">Memory on the stack or the heap</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, memory is typically allocated either on the stack or the heap. The stack and heap are two different regions of memory that are used for different purposes.</p>
<p>The stack is a region of memory that is used for storing local variables and function call frames. Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created to store the function's local variables and other data. When the function returns, its stack frame is destroyed, and the memory used by the stack frame is released.</p>
<p>Stack allocation is fast and efficient, because the memory for a stack frame is allocated when the function is called, and released when the function returns. This means that stack allocation doesn't require any runtime overhead, making it an excellent choice for small, short-lived objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the heap is a region of memory that is used for dynamically allocated data. Data allocated on the heap persists until it is explicitly deallocated. Heap allocation can be slower and less efficient than stack allocation, because it requires additional runtime overhead to allocate and deallocate memory.</p>
<p>In Rust, heap allocation is typically done using the Box type, which creates a pointer to a value that is stored on the heap. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(5);
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>x</code> is a pointer to a value of 5 that is stored on the heap. The <code>Box::new()</code> function allocates memory on the heap and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The <code>println!()</code> macro prints the value of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps ensure that heap-allocated memory is used safely and efficiently. By enforcing strict rules around memory management, Rust makes it possible to write high-performance, memory-safe code without the need for garbage collection or other runtime memory management.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory-ownership-and-borrowing"><a class="header" href="#memory-ownership-and-borrowing">Memory ownership and borrowing</a></h1>
<p>Rust uses a unique system for managing memory called &quot;ownership&quot;. Ownership is a key concept in Rust, which helps ensure memory safety and prevents many common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing, use-after-free, and data races.</p>
<p>In Rust, each value has an owner, which is responsible for managing the memory associated with that value. When a value is created, its ownership is assigned to the variable that holds it. Ownership can then be transferred to another variable, passed as a function argument, or returned from a function. When the variable that owns a value goes out of scope, the value is automatically deallocated.</p>
<p>This ownership model allows Rust to guarantee memory safety at compile-time, without the need for a garbage collector or manual memory management. It does so by enforcing a set of rules that ensure that each value is owned by only one variable at a time, that ownership can be transferred but not shared, and that every value is deallocated exactly once when it goes out of scope.</p>
<p>In addition to ownership, Rust also provides a mechanism for borrowing, which allows multiple variables to have temporary access to a value without taking ownership of it. This allows for efficient and flexible memory management, while still ensuring that memory safety is maintained.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust's memory ownership model provides a powerful and safe way to manage memory in a concurrent and parallel programming environment.</p>
<p>Here's an example of memory ownership and borrowing in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // Define a vector of integers
    let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // Pass a reference to the vector to a function
    print_vec(&amp;vec);

    // Modify the vector
    vec.push(4);

    // Pass ownership of the vector to a function
    take_vec(vec);
}

fn print_vec(vec: &amp;Vec&lt;i32&gt;) {
    // Iterate over the vector and print each element
    for num in vec {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, num);
    }
}

fn take_vec(vec: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) {
    // Do something with the vector
    println!(&quot;Took ownership of {:?}&quot;, vec);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a vector of integers and then pass a reference to the vector to a function called <code>print_vec</code>. The <code>print_vec</code> function borrows the reference to the vector and iterates over it, printing each element.</p>
<p>Next, we modify the vector by pushing another element onto it, and then pass ownership of the vector to a function called <code>take_vec</code>. The <code>take_vec</code> function takes ownership of the vector and prints a message to indicate that it has ownership of the vector.</p>
<p>Notice that we use the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a reference to the vector to <code>print_vec</code>. This is an example of borrowing in Rust - we borrow a reference to the vector without taking ownership of it.</p>
<p>In contrast, when we pass the vector to <code>take_vec</code>, we don't use the <code>&amp;</code> operator. This is an example of taking ownership in Rust - we transfer ownership of the vector to the <code>take_vec</code> function.</p>
<p>Memory ownership and borrowing are important concepts in Rust, and they help ensure that Rust code is both efficient and safe. By carefully managing memory ownership and borrowing, Rust programmers can write code that is fast, reliable, and secure.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mutability-and-immutability"><a class="header" href="#mutability-and-immutability">Mutability and immutability</a></h1>
<p>Rust provides strict control over mutable and immutable references to data. Rust's approach to mutability and immutability helps to prevent many common programming errors, such as null pointer references, race conditions, and other types of undefined behavior.</p>
<p>In Rust, a variable's mutability is determined by whether or not it was declared with the <code>mut</code> keyword. If a variable is declared with <code>mut</code>, it is mutable, meaning it can be changed. If it is not declared with <code>mut</code>, it is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a mutable variable in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // This is allowed because x is mutable.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>And here is an example of an immutable variable in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let x = 5;
x = 6; // This is not allowed because x is immutable.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Immutable variables are useful for ensuring that data remains constant and unchanging. They can help to prevent accidental modification of data and make programs easier to reason about. On the other hand, mutable variables can be useful for cases where data needs to be updated or changed.</p>
<p>In Rust, mutability is also closely tied to references to data. Rust uses a concept called borrowing to ensure that mutable and immutable references to data do not overlap in ways that could cause undefined behavior.</p>
<p>When a variable is borrowed as mutable, the borrowing function gains exclusive access to the data, meaning that no other function can access it until the mutable reference goes out of scope. Conversely, when a variable is borrowed as immutable, multiple functions can access the data at the same time, as long as they are not trying to modify it.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust's approach to mutability and immutability is designed to make programs more reliable and less prone to errors. By providing strict control over how data can be accessed and modified, Rust helps to prevent many common programming mistakes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="test-framework-and-test-assertions"><a class="header" href="#test-framework-and-test-assertions">Test framework and test assertions</a></h1>
<p>Rust has a built-in testing framework that allows developers to write and run automated tests for their Rust code. The testing framework is designed to be easy to use, and it supports a wide range of testing scenarios, including unit tests, integration tests, and benchmark tests.</p>
<p>To write tests in Rust, developers create test functions that are annotated with the #[test] attribute. These functions can contain one or more test assertions that check whether a particular condition is true or false. If all assertions in a test function pass, the test is considered to have passed. If any assertion fails, the test is considered to have failed.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a simple test function in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[test]
fn test_addition() {
    let result = 2 + 2;
    assert_eq!(result, 4);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>test_addition</code> function tests whether the addition of two numbers results in the expected value. The <code>assert_eq!</code> macro compares the result of the addition with the expected value of 4. If the addition results in anything other than 4, the assertion will fail, and the test will fail.</p>
<p>To run tests in Rust, developers use the <code>cargo test</code> command, which runs all tests in a Rust project and reports the results. The cargo test command can also be used to run specific tests or groups of tests, and it provides a range of options for controlling the behavior of the testing framework.</p>
<p>In addition to unit tests, Rust's testing framework also supports integration tests, which test the interaction between different modules or components of a Rust application, and benchmark tests, which measure the performance of Rust code under different conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust's built-in testing framework provides a convenient and efficient way to write and run automated tests for Rust code, making it easy to ensure that Rust applications are correct, reliable, and performant.</p>
<h2 id="test-assertions"><a class="header" href="#test-assertions">Test assertions</a></h2>
<p>The Rust testing framework provides macros for writing test assertions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>assert_eq!(a, b)</code> and <code>assert_ne!(a, b)</code>: Checks whether two values are equal or not equal, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>assert!(condition)</code>: Checks whether a condition is true.</p>

<p>Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual software components or units are tested in isolation to ensure that they behave as expected. In Rust, unit testing involves writing tests that validate the expected behavior of functions, methods, and other individual units of code.</p>
<p>Rust provides a built-in testing framework for unit testing called <code>cargo test</code>. Here are the steps involved in Rust unit testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write the unit tests: Unit tests in Rust are typically placed in the same file as the code they are testing. These tests should be written to validate the expected behavior of individual functions or methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Rust's testing framework: Rust's testing framework provides a set of macros and functions for writing and running tests. The <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> attribute indicates that a Rust module contains tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write test assertions: Rust's testing framework provides a set of assertions that can be used to validate the output of functions or methods being tested. These assertions can be used to check that a value is equal to an expected value, that a value is greater than or less than an expected value, and other conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the tests: Unit tests in Rust can be run using the <code>cargo test</code> command. This command compiles and runs all the tests in the project, including the unit tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze the test results: After the tests have run, the output of the tests can be analyzed to determine whether the unit tests have passed or failed. Rust's testing framework provides detailed information about the tests that have been run, including the number of tests that have passed or failed and the reason for the failures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps, developers can use Rust's unit testing framework to validate the behavior of individual components of the software, ensuring that each unit behaves as expected and functions correctly as part of the larger system.</p>

<p>Integration testing is a software testing technique where individual software modules are tested as a group to validate their combined functionality. In Rust, integration testing involves testing the interactions between different modules or components of the software.</p>
<p>Rust provides a built-in testing framework for integration testing called <code>cargo test</code>. Here are the steps involved in Rust integration testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a separate directory for integration tests: Integration tests in Rust are typically placed in a separate directory called <code>tests</code> at the top level of the project. This directory contains Rust files that end with <code>_test.rs</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the integration tests: Integration tests in Rust are similar to unit tests but test the interaction between different modules or components. These tests should be written to validate the expected behavior of the system as a whole.</p>

<p>Rust doc tests are a form of Rust's testing framework that allows developers to include tests in the documentation of their code. This allows developers to write code examples and tests in the documentation itself, ensuring that the documentation remains up-to-date and accurate.</p>
<p>Here are the steps involved in using Rust doc tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write the doc tests: Rust doc tests are written as code examples in the documentation of a Rust function or module. The code examples should demonstrate the expected behavior of the function or module.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="source-based-coverage"><a class="header" href="#source-based-coverage">Source-based coverage</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, source-based coverage is a way of measuring how much of a Rust codebase is executed during a test suite. This type of coverage analysis works by instrumenting the Rust code and tracking which lines of code are executed during a test run.</p>
<p>The process of generating source-based coverage typically involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instrumentation: The Rust code is modified to include extra code that tracks which lines of code are executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test Execution: The test suite is run against the instrumented code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coverage Report Generation: The data collected during the test run generates a report that shows which lines of code were executed and which were not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting coverage report provides developers with insights into the effectiveness of their tests and helps identify areas of the code that are not being sufficiently exercised by the test suite.</p>
<p>One key advantage of Rust source-based coverage is that it can provide more accurate coverage measurements than alternative methods, such as binary-based coverage. This is because source-based coverage is able to account for control structures, such as branches and loops, which can lead to different paths through the code being executed.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust source-based coverage is a valuable tool for ensuring the quality and reliability of Rust codebases, and can help developers identify areas for improvement in their testing strategies.</p>

<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that will be tested. The goal of TDD is to create higher quality, more maintainable code by ensuring that code is written to pass tests that validate the intended behavior.</p>
<p>In Rust, TDD involves creating tests that ensure that the code functions correctly and provides the expected output. Here are the steps involved in Rust TDD:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write a failing test: The first step is to write a test that validates the intended behavior of the code. This test should fail, indicating that the code does not yet meet the desired behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the simplest code possible to pass the test: After writing the failing test, write the simplest code possible to make the test pass. This code should be written with the goal of passing the test, not creating a complete solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactor the code: After the test passes, refactor the code to improve its design and readability, while still ensuring that the test continues to pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the process: Continue this process of writing failing tests, writing the simplest code possible to pass the test, and refactoring the code until the code meets the desired behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Rust, TDD can be implemented using Rust's built-in testing framework. This framework allows developers to write tests using Rust's macro syntax and provides a set of assertions that can be used to validate the output of the code being tested.</p>
<p>By following the TDD approach in Rust, developers can create code that is reliable, maintainable, and easier to understand, while also reducing the number of bugs and issues that arise during development.</p>

<p>Cargo uses a file called <code>Cargo.toml</code> to manage the configuration and dependencies of a Rust project. The <code>Cargo.toml</code> file specifies the name of the package, version information, and the dependencies of the project. Cargo also provides a command-line interface that allows developers to manage their Rust projects and dependencies easily.</p>
<p>A Rust package managed by Cargo is called a &quot;crate.&quot; A crate can either be a binary or a library. A binary crate is an executable program, while a library crate is a collection of reusable code that can be used by other programs.</p>
<p>Cargo provides a standardized directory structure for Rust projects. By convention, the main source code of a project is placed in a directory called src, and the project configuration and dependencies are specified in a file called <code>Cargo.toml</code>. Cargo uses the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file to keep track of exact dependency versions used in the project.</p>
<p>Cargo also provides a number of commands to manage a Rust project. Some of the commonly used commands include:</p>

<li>
<p>Correctness: These lints check for potential errors that can cause undefined behavior, such as null pointer dereferences, out-of-bounds array access, and other common issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Style: These lints check for coding style issues, such as using inconsistent indentation, unnecessary parentheses, and redundant code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance: These lints check for potential performance issues, such as using slow algorithms or redundant calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity: These lints check for overly complex code, such as deeply nested functions or overly complicated expressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security: These lints check for potential security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, unsafe code, and other issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clippy is highly customizable, allowing developers to enable or disable specific lints, customize the severity level of lints, and even create custom lints tailored to their specific needs. It is also regularly updated with new lints and improvements, making it a valuable tool for improving Rust code quality and preventing bugs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rustfmt-for-code-formatting"><a class="header" href="#rustfmt-for-code-formatting">Rustfmt for code formatting</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt">https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt</a></p>
<p>Rustfmt is a code formatting tool for Rust programming language. It automatically reformats Rust code according to a set of predefined formatting rules, which helps developers to maintain consistent coding styles and makes it easier to read, understand and debug the code.</p>
<p>Rustfmt can be used as a standalone tool, or as an integrated feature within a code editor, or via a build script. It supports a variety of formatting options, including indentation style, line wrapping, brace styles, and more.</p>
<p>Using Rustfmt is highly recommended by the Rust community as it helps maintain a consistent coding style across a project, which in turn makes the code easier to read, maintain and understand.</p>
<p>To use Rustfmt, you first need to install it on your system. Rustfmt can be installed using Cargo, the package manager for Rust, by running the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo install rustfmt
</code></pre>
<p>You can customize the formatting rules used by Rustfmt by creating a configuration file named <code>rustfmt.toml</code> or <code>.rustfmt.toml</code> in your project directory and specifying your preferred options. </p>
<p>Example <code>rustfmt.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">comment_width = 80
format_code_in_doc_comments = true
group_imports = &quot;StdExternalCrate&quot;
imports_granularity = &quot;Crate&quot;
imports_layout = &quot;Vertical&quot;
indent_style = &quot;Block&quot;
reorder_imports = false
wrap_comments = true
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, Rustfmt is a good tool to reformat code, and to maintain consistent coding styles.</p>
<h2 id="rustfmt-usage"><a class="header" href="#rustfmt-usage">Rustfmt usage</a></h2>
<p>To use Rustfmt as a standalone tool: You can format Rust code using Rustfmt directly from the command line by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">rustfmt &lt;filename.rs&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This command will format the Rust code in the specified file and print the formatted output to the terminal. If you want to save the formatted output to a file, you can use the -w option followed by the filename, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">rustfmt -w &lt;filename.rs&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To use Rustfmt as an integrated feature within a code editor: Rustfmt can be integrated with popular code editors like VSCode, Atom, and Sublime Text. To do this, you need to install a Rustfmt extension for your editor, and then configure it to format your code on save or on demand.</p>
<p>For example, in VSCode, you can install the &quot;Rustfmt&quot; extension and configure it to format your code on save by adding the following line to your <code>settings.json</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;editor.formatOnSave&quot;: true
</code></pre>
<p>This will format your Rust code automatically every time you save a file.</p>
<p>To use Rustfmt via a build script: If you want to format your Rust code as part of your build process, you can use a build script that runs Rustfmt on your code before compiling it. You can create a build script by adding the following line to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
build = &quot;rustfmt &lt;filename.rs&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This will run Rustfmt on the specified file before compiling your project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rust-mdbook-for-documentation"><a class="header" href="#rust-mdbook-for-documentation">Rust mdBook for documentation</a></h1>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cross-compiling-for-multiple-platforms"><a class="header" href="#cross-compiling-for-multiple-platforms">Cross-compiling for multiple platforms</a></h1>
<p>Cross-compiling is the process of compiling code for a platform different from the one on which the code is compiled. Rust supports cross-compiling, which means that you can compile Rust code on one platform and generate executable code for another platform, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS.</p>
<p>To cross-compile Rust code, you need to install a cross-compiler toolchain for the target platform. This toolchain includes the Rust compiler, standard library, and any other dependencies required to build the code. You can install cross-compilers for different architectures using Rust's built-in tool, rustup.</p>
<p>Once the cross-compiler toolchain is installed, you can use the cargo command to build your Rust project for the target platform. You can specify the target platform by setting the --target option when running the cargo build or cargo run command. For example, to build a Rust project for the ARM architecture, you would use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo build --target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
</code></pre>
<p>This command tells cargo to build the project for the ARM architecture using the GNU toolchain and the Hard Float ABI.</p>
<p>Cross-compiling Rust code can be useful for a variety of scenarios, such as building applications for embedded systems or developing software that needs to run on multiple platforms. Rust's strong type system and memory safety guarantees make it a good choice for writing cross-platform applications that require high performance and reliability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rhai-script"><a class="header" href="#rhai-script">Rhai script</a></h1>
<p>Rhai is an embedded scripting language for Rust that is designed to be easy to use and integrate with Rust applications. Rhai is a dynamically typed language with support for high-level data types such as arrays, maps, and functions. It also supports Rust-style ownership and borrowing, making it easy to integrate with Rust's memory management system.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Rhai is its safety and security. Rhai enforces sandboxing by default, which means that scripts executed within a Rhai interpreter cannot access or modify the host environment. Rhai also supports a variety of security features such as timeouts, memory limits, and access controls to ensure that scripts cannot cause harm to the host application.</p>
<p>Rhai's syntax is similar to Rust's syntax, making it easy for Rust developers to learn and use. Rhai also provides a number of built-in functions and operators that simplify common scripting tasks such as string manipulation, math operations, and control flow.</p>
<p>Overall, Rhai is a powerful and safe scripting language that is well-suited for Rust applications. Its ease of use and security features make it a great choice for developers who want to add scripting capabilities to their Rust applications.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using Rust as an embedded language in Rhai script to perform arithmetic operations:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use rhai::{Engine, EvalAltResult};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut engine = Engine::new();
    
    let result = engine.eval::&lt;i32&gt;(&quot;2 + 2&quot;)?;
    println!(&quot;2 + 2 = {}&quot;, result); // should print 4
    
    let result = engine.eval::&lt;f64&gt;(&quot;3.14 * 2.0&quot;)?;
    println!(&quot;3.14 * 2.0 = {}&quot;, result); // should print 6.28
    
    let result = engine.eval::&lt;i32&gt;(&quot;10 / 3&quot;)?;
    println!(&quot;10 / 3 = {}&quot;, result); // should print 3
    
    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the Rhai script is used to evaluate arithmetic expressions, while Rust is used as an embedded language to perform the actual calculations. This allows for the use of Rust's strong typing and performance while still being able to execute dynamic code using Rhai.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="abstract-syntax-tree-ast"><a class="header" href="#abstract-syntax-tree-ast">Abstract syntax tree (AST)</a></h1>
<p>An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used in computer science to represent the structure of a program in a way that can be easily analyzed and manipulated by algorithms.</p>
<p>An AST is created by analyzing the source code of a program and breaking it down into a tree-like structure that represents its syntax. Each node in the tree represents a syntactic construct in the program, such as a function call, a variable declaration, or an if statement. The nodes in the tree are connected by edges that represent the relationships between the constructs.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using an AST is that it provides a way to analyze the program's structure and behavior without having to execute the code. This makes it possible to perform tasks such as code optimization, program transformation, and error detection without having to actually run the program.</p>
<p>ASTs are commonly used in compilers, interpreters, and other tools that analyze or manipulate source code. For example, a compiler may use an AST to perform optimizations such as dead code elimination or loop unrolling, while a static analyzer may use an AST to detect potential security vulnerabilities or other code quality issues.</p>
<p>Overall, abstract syntax trees are a powerful tool for working with programs, allowing developers to reason about their structure and behavior in a way that is both precise and efficient.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tree-sitter-parsing-library"><a class="header" href="#tree-sitter-parsing-library">Tree-sitter parsing library</a></h1>
<p>Tree-sitter is a parsing library that allows developers to create robust and efficient parsers for programming languages, configuration files, and other structured documents. It was created by Rasmus Andersson and is written in Rust.</p>
<p>The library uses the tree-sitter parsing algorithm, which is a powerful parsing technique that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the parsed code. The AST is a tree structure that represents the structure of the code, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of Rust tree-sitter is its speed and efficiency. It is designed to be extremely fast, allowing it to handle large codebases and parse files in real-time. It also uses incremental parsing, which means that it can efficiently update the AST as changes are made to the code.</p>
<p>Rust tree-sitter is also highly modular, with a simple and flexible API that allows developers to easily create custom parsers for new languages or modify existing parsers. It supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and many others.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust tree-sitter is a powerful and flexible parsing library that can be used to create high-performance parsers for a wide range of programming languages and structured documents.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="language-server-protocol-lsp"><a class="header" href="#language-server-protocol-lsp">Language Server Protocol (LSP)</a></h1>
<p>Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a communication protocol between an editor or an IDE and a language server that provides language-specific features such as code completion, error checking, and symbol search. </p>
<p>The Language Server Protocol is used by many popular editors and IDEs, and is supported by many programming languages.</p>
<p>Using the Language Server Protocol, editors and IDEs can provide consistent language features across multiple programming languages and language servers, without having to implement language-specific functionality themselves. This allows for faster and more efficient development, as developers can use their preferred editor or IDE and still have access to advanced language features.</p>
<p>The LSP defines a set of standard JSON-RPC methods that the client and server can use to communicate. These methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>initialize</code>: Used to initialize the language server and configure its capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>shutdown</code>: Used to shut down the language server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>textDocument/didOpen</code>: Notifies the server that a text document has been opened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>textDocument/didChange</code>: Notifies the server that a text document has been modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>textDocument/completion</code>: Requests code completion suggestions for a given text document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>textDocument/hover</code>: Requests information about a symbol at a given location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>textDocument/references</code>: Requests a list of references to a symbol at a given location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Language Server Protocol is an open standard. The protocol is implemented in a client-server architecture, where the client is an editor or IDE that supports the LSP, and the server is a language server that provides language-specific functionality.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="static-analysis-for-error-detection"><a class="header" href="#static-analysis-for-error-detection">Static analysis for error detection</a></h1>
<p>Static analysis is the process of analyzing code without executing it, to detect potential errors or issues before the code is actually run. Rust has a strong focus on static analysis, with the goal of catching as many errors as possible at compile time, before the code is even executed.</p>
<p>Rust's static analysis features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Static typing: Rust is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This helps catch many common errors, such as trying to add a string and a number, before the code is even run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ownership and borrowing: Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps prevent memory errors such as null pointer dereferences or use-after-free bugs. The compiler enforces rules around how references to data are created, modified, and used, to ensure that they are safe and sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifetimes: Rust's lifetime system helps ensure that references to data are valid for as long as they are needed. This prevents common errors such as dangling pointers or double frees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Macros: Rust's macro system allows developers to write code that generates other code at compile time. This can be used to perform custom static analysis or generate repetitive code automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clippy: Clippy is a community-maintained linter for Rust that provides additional static analysis checks beyond what the compiler itself does. Clippy checks for common coding mistakes, such as unused variables, and provides suggestions for how to fix them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Rust's strong focus on static analysis helps catch many errors before they occur, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making it easier to write safe and reliable code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="design-patterns"><a class="header" href="#design-patterns">Design patterns</a></h1>
<p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They are not unique to Rust, but Rust developers can use many of the same design patterns found in other languages. Here are some examples of design patterns.</p>
<h2 id="iterator"><a class="header" href="#iterator">Iterator</a></h2>
<p>The iterator pattern provides a way to iterate over a collection of objects. In Rust, this is built into the language with the Iterator trait.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for number in numbers.iter() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, number);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="singleton"><a class="header" href="#singleton">Singleton</a></h2>
<p>The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a particular object is ever created. In Rust, this can be implemented using a static variable or a lazy static variable.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Singleton;

                let singleton = Singleton {};
                INSTANCE = mem::transmute(Box::new(singleton));
            });

            &amp;*INSTANCE
        }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="builder"><a class="header" href="#builder">Builder</a></h2>
<p>The builder pattern creates complex objects by breaking down the creation process into a series of simpler steps. In Rust, this can be implemented using the builder pattern.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

<h2 id="observer"><a class="header" href="#observer">Observer</a></h2>
<p>Observer: The observer pattern allows one object to notify others of its state changes. In Rust, this can be implemented using Rust's channels or event emitters. For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {

}</code></pre></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dependency-injection-di"><a class="header" href="#dependency-injection-di">Dependency injection (DI)</a></h1>
<p>Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that reduces the coupling between different components of a software system. In Rust, DI can be implemented using various techniques, such as trait objects, closures, and macros.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind DI is that instead of a component creating its dependencies directly, it receives them from an external source. This allows the component to be more flexible and easier to test, since its dependencies can be easily substituted with mock objects or other implementations.</p>
<p>In Rust, one way to implement DI is through the use of trait objects. A trait object is a pointer to a value that implements a specific trait. By using trait objects, we can create components that depend on abstractions rather than concrete types. For example, instead of a component depending on a specific implementation of a database connection, it could depend on a trait object that represents a generic database connection. This would allow us to easily swap out different database implementations without affecting the component's code.</p>
<p>Another way to implement DI in Rust is through the use of closures. A closure is a function that captures variables from its surrounding environment. By passing a closure to a component, we can provide it with the functionality it needs without directly creating dependencies on concrete types.</p>
<p>Finally, Rust also has several macro libraries, such as <code>di-rs</code>, that provide DI capabilities through code generation. These macros allow developers to define their dependencies in a declarative way, and generate the necessary code to wire everything together.</p>
<p>In summary, DI is a design pattern that helps reduce coupling between components in a software system. In Rust, DI can be implemented using various techniques such as trait objects, closures, and macros, and can provide benefits such as improved flexibility and testability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="domain-driven-design-ddd"><a class="header" href="#domain-driven-design-ddd">Domain-driven design (DDD)</a></h1>
<p>Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes building software that reflects the business domain it is intended to serve. In Rust, DDD involves structuring the codebase around the domain model, ensuring that the code is easy to understand, and that changes to the domain can be made without causing issues elsewhere in the system.</p>
<p>Here are some key principles of Rust DDD:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Separation of concerns: DDD encourages separating the domain model from other parts of the system. In Rust, this means creating separate modules for each component of the domain model and using Rust's module system to control access to these modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ubiquitous language: DDD emphasizes using a common language between developers and domain experts. In Rust, this means using Rust's type system to create types and structs that map directly to domain concepts, and using descriptive variable and function names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entities and value objects: In DDD, entities are objects that have a unique identity, and value objects are objects that are identified by their attributes. In Rust, entities and value objects can be implemented as Rust structs with associated methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregates: Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects that should be treated as a single unit of consistency. In Rust, aggregates can be implemented as Rust structs with associated methods that enforce consistency constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repositories: Repositories provide a way to retrieve and store aggregates. In Rust, repositories can be implemented as Rust traits with associated methods for retrieving and storing aggregates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these principles, Rust DDD can help developers create software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, while also ensuring that the software accurately reflects the business domain it is intended to serve.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="model-view-controller-mvc"><a class="header" href="#model-view-controller-mvc">Model-view-controller (MVC)</a></h1>
<p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering for developing user interfaces. It provides a way to separate an application's data (the Model), user interface (the View), and control logic (the Controller) into separate components, which helps in making the code more modular, easier to understand, and maintain.</p>
<p>In the context of Rust, the Model-View-Controller pattern is often used in web application development, where the Model represents the application's data, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller acts as the glue between the two.</p>
<p>Here's how the components work together in Rust's MVC pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It defines the data structures and operations for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data. In a web application, the Model typically interacts with a database or other persistent storage to retrieve and store data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It defines the user interface elements, such as HTML templates, and renders the data provided by the Controller. In a web application, the View generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the user sees in their browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controller: The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and View components. It receives input from the user, processes it, and updates the Model as necessary. It also retrieves data from the Model and passes it to the View for rendering. In a web application, the Controller handles HTTP requests and responses, and performs any necessary data validation and business logic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By separating the application's data, user interface, and control logic into separate components, the MVC pattern makes it easier to maintain and modify the application. For example, if you want to change the user interface, you can modify the View without affecting the underlying data or business logic. Similarly, if you want to change the way data is stored or manipulated, you can modify the Model without affecting the user interface.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="object-oriented-versus-functional"><a class="header" href="#object-oriented-versus-functional">Object-oriented versus functional</a></h1>
<p>Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming styles. Rust's object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on the concept of structs and traits, while its functional programming (FP) is based on the use of closures and higher-order functions.</p>
<p>In Rust's OOP, programmers can create structs that contain data fields and methods. The methods can be used to manipulate the data fields of the struct. Traits can also be used to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any struct that wants to use that trait. Traits can be used for polymorphism, allowing different structs to be used interchangeably as long as they implement the required trait.</p>
<p>In Rust's FP, programmers can use closures and higher-order functions to create functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. Closures are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding environment. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. These concepts enable the creation of functions that are more flexible and reusable than traditional imperative programming.</p>
<p>The Rust programming language emphasizes safety and performance, which is reflected in its support for both OOP and FP. Rust's OOP provides a safe and efficient way to define data structures and methods that operate on them, while Rust's FP provides a safe and efficient way to define algorithms and functions that can be composed and reused in various contexts.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="procedural-versus-functional"><a class="header" href="#procedural-versus-functional">Procedural versus functional</a></h1>
<p>Pprocedural programming and functional programming are two different paradigms of software development. Rust supports both procedural and functional programming styles, and developers can choose which style to use based on the specific requirements of their application.</p>
<p>In procedural programming, code is organized around procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. Procedural code is typically organized in a linear fashion, with each function calling other functions to perform the necessary operations. In procedural programming, the focus is on the step-by-step instructions necessary to solve a problem, rather than on data transformations.</p>
<p>In Rust, procedural code is often used for low-level systems programming tasks, where performance is critical. For example, writing code to interact with hardware devices or to implement low-level algorithms may require a procedural style.</p>
<p>Functional programming, on the other hand, focuses on the transformation of data through the use of pure functions. A pure function is a function that produces a result based only on its input, and has no side effects. In functional programming, the emphasis is on the composition of functions to create more complex operations, rather than on step-by-step procedures.</p>
<p>In Rust, functional programming is often used for higher-level programming tasks, such as data analysis and web development. Rust's support for functional programming is largely due to its support for closures, higher-order functions, and immutable data structures.</p>
<p>In summary, Rust supports both procedural and functional programming styles, and developers can choose which style to use based on the specific requirements of their application. Procedural programming is often used for lower-level programming, while functional programming is often used for higher-level programming.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="resource-acquisition-is-initialization-raii"><a class="header" href="#resource-acquisition-is-initialization-raii">Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</a></h1>
<p>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a fundamental concept in Rust and many other programming languages, particularly those with a focus on memory safety and reliability.</p>
<p>At its core, RAII is a way of managing resources such as memory, files, network connections, or any other system resource that requires some form of cleanup or management. The basic idea is that when you acquire a resource, you should initialize an object that represents that resource, and when that object is no longer needed or goes out of scope, its destructor is called, which releases the resource.</p>
<p>In Rust, RAII is implemented through the use of ownership and the <code>Drop</code> trait. Whenever an object is created in Rust, it is associated with an owner that is responsible for managing its memory and resources. When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the <code>Drop</code> trait implementation for that object, which allows the object to clean up any resources it may have acquired.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how RAII works in Rust with the File type from the standard library:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;

fn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let file = File::create(&quot;example.txt&quot;)?;

    // Do some work with the file...

    // The `file` variable goes out of scope here, and its destructor is called.
    // This releases any resources associated with the file, including closing the file handle.
    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we create a new <code>File</code> object using the <code>File::create()</code> method, which opens a new file for writing. When we're done working with the file, the file variable goes out of scope and its destructor is called automatically by Rust. This closes the file handle and frees any resources associated with the file.</p>
<p>RAII is a powerful technique for managing resources in Rust, and it helps ensure that your programs are both safe and reliable. By relying on RAII and the ownership system, Rust programs can avoid many common problems such as resource leaks, null pointer dereferences, and other forms of undefined behavior.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="solid-principles-for-software-design"><a class="header" href="#solid-principles-for-software-design">SOLID principles for software design</a></h1>
<p>The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to make software designs more flexible, maintainable, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>In Rust, these principles can be applied to help developers write code that is easier to maintain and extend over time. Here is a brief overview of each of the SOLID principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a module or class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a module should have only one responsibility or job, and it should not be responsible for doing more than that. This helps to keep the code more organized, easier to understand, and more maintainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open/Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that a module or class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the functionality of a module or class without having to modify its existing code. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that a subclass should be able to replace its parent class without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that a subclass should be able to behave as expected by the client code, without requiring any modifications to the client code. This helps to ensure that code is more modular and easier to maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle states that a module or class should only expose the methods and properties that are necessary for its clients. In other words, a module or class should not force its clients to depend on methods or properties that they do not need. This helps to reduce dependencies and make the code more maintainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules or classes should not depend on low-level modules or classes, but on abstractions. This means that you should define interfaces and abstractions to represent the dependencies in your code, rather than depending directly on concrete implementations. This helps to make the code more flexible, easier to test, and easier to maintain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-law-of-demeter"><a class="header" href="#the-law-of-demeter">The Law of Demeter</a></h1>
<p>The Law of Demeter is a design principle that applies to object-oriented programming, including Rust. The Law of Demeter, also known as the &quot;principle of least knowledge,&quot; states that an object should have limited knowledge of other objects, and that it should only interact with objects that are directly related to its purpose.</p>
<p>In Rust, this principle can be applied by designing your code to minimize the number of dependencies between different components of your application. This can be achieved by following a few key guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each module or object should only communicate with its immediate neighbors, and not with objects further down the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a module or object needs to interact with another object, it should only communicate with its public interface, and not directly with its internal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid passing long chains of dependencies or complex objects between modules or functions. Instead, pass only the information or data that is necessary for the task at hand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following the Law of Demeter, you can help ensure that your code is more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. It also helps to make your code more scalable and flexible, as changes to one module or object will have less impact on the rest of the application.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="assertables-crate-for-assert-macro-tests"><a class="header" href="#assertables-crate-for-assert-macro-tests">Assertables crate for assert macro tests</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/assertables">https://crates.io/crates/assertables</a></p>
<p>The Rust Assertables crate is a library for assert macro functionality, for Rust testing, validation, and verification. If an assert macro succeeds, then it completes normally. If an assert macro fails, then it prints an error message with debugging information. </p>
<p>To use Asseretables, add it to your project's dependencies in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
assertables = &quot;7&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a simple example of how to use the Assertables crate:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[cfg(test)]
mod test_assert_x_result {
    use assertables;

    #[test]
    fn example1() {
        let x = 1;
        let y = 2;
        assert_lt!(x, y);
    }

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/itertools">https://crates.io/crates/itertools</a></p>
<p>The Rust itertools crate is a third-party library that provides a powerful set of tools for working with iterators in Rust. It offers a wide range of functions and macros for manipulating and combining iterators, making it easier and more efficient to work with collections of data in Rust.</p>
<p>To use the itertools crate in your Rust project, you'll need to add it as a dependency in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file. Once you've done that, you can import the crate and start using its functions and macros.</p>
<p>Iteration Functions: The itertools crate provides functions that can be used to manipulate and transform iterators. For example, the enumerate function adds an index to each element of an iterator, while the zip function combines multiple iterators into a single iterator of tuples:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

    println!(&quot;{}: {}{}&quot;, i, n, l);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Combinator Functions: The itertools crate provides functions that can be used to generate new iterators from existing iterators. For example, the product function generates the Cartesian product of two iterators, while the permutations function generates all possible permutations of an iterator:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use itertools::Itertools;

let numbers = vec![1, 2];
let letters = vec!['a', 'b'];

for (n, l) in numbers.iter().cartesian_product(letters.iter()) {
    println!(&quot;{}{}&quot;, n, l);
}

for p in letters.iter().permutations(2) {
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, p);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Macros: The itertools crate also provides macros that can be used to simplify the code required to work with iterators. For example, the <code>assert_equal</code> macro can be used to test that two iterators are equal, while the <code>join</code> macro can be used to concatenate multiple iterators into a single iterator:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use itertools::assert_equal;
use itertools::join;

let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

assert_equal(numbers.iter().map(|x| x * x), squares.iter());

let lists = vec![vec![1, 2], vec![3, 4], vec![5, 6]];
let flattened = join(lists.iter());

assert_equal(flattened, vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].iter());

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="log-crate-for-logging-messages"><a class="header" href="#log-crate-for-logging-messages">log crate for logging messages</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/log">https://crates.io/crates/log</a></p>
<p>The Rust log crate provides a logging framework for Rust programs. The log crate provides a simple interface for logging messages at different levels of severity, such as debug, info, warn, and error.</p>
<p>To use the log crate, you need to first define a logger implementation. This implementation defines how the log messages are recorded and where they are sent. There are many different logger implementations available in the Rust ecosystem, such as the simple_logger crate, env_logger crate, and fern crate.</p>
<p>Once you have defined a logger implementation, you can start logging messages using the log crate's macros. The most commonly used macros are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>debug!</code>: logs a message at the debug severity level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>info!</code>: logs a message at the info severity level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>warn!</code>: logs a message at the warn severity level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>error!</code>: logs a message at the error severity level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The log crate provides a number of other macros and functions for working with log messages, such as formatting log messages with placeholders and recording the file name and line number where the log message was generated.</p>
<p>The log crate also allows you to configure the logging behavior at runtime by setting the log level and enabling or disabling specific loggers. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<p>Overall, the Rust log crate provides a flexible and powerful logging framework for Rust programs that can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases.</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/once_cell">https://crates.io/crates/once_cell</a></p>
<p>The Rust once_cell crate provides a way to create lazily evaluated, immutable, and thread-safe global variables in Rust. It is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to handle global state in Rust programs.</p>
<p>The main type provided by the once_cell crate is the OnceCell<T> type. This type is a container for a single value of type T that can be initialized lazily and only once. When the value is accessed for the first time, it is created using a closure that is passed to the OnceCell's get_or_init method. The closure is executed only once, and the resulting value is stored in the OnceCell for future accesses.</p>
<p>The OnceCell type is also thread-safe, which means that multiple threads can access the same OnceCell instance safely. If multiple threads attempt to access the OnceCell at the same time, only one of them will be allowed to execute the initialization closure, while the other threads will block until the value is fully initialized.</p>
<p>The OnceCell crate also provides other useful types, such as the unsync::OnceCell<T> type, which is similar to the regular OnceCell<T> but is not thread-safe, and the sync::Lazy<T> type, which is similar to the OnceCell<T> but provides an additional level of indirection that allows for even more efficient initialization and access.</p>
<p>Example of once_cell <code>Lazy</code> to intialize a <code>Regex</code> regular expression:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use regex::Regex;
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;

fn main() {
    static RE: Lazy&lt;Regex&gt; = Lazy::new(||Regex::new(&quot;hello&quot;).unwrap());
    let matched = RE.is_match(&quot;hello world&quot;);
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, matched);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Overall, the Rust once_cell crate is a useful tool for managing global state in Rust programs, especially in cases where lazy initialization and thread-safety are important. It provides a simple and efficient API for creating and accessing lazily evaluated global variables that can be used in a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>The regex crate is based on the popular PCRE library, which is widely used in many programming languages for regular expression support. However, the Rust regex crate is designed specifically for Rust and provides a native Rust API that is both safe and easy to use.</p>
<p>The main types provided by the regex crate are the <code>Regex</code> and <code>Captures</code> types. The <code>Regex</code> type represents a compiled regular expression pattern that can be used to search for matches in a text string. The <code>Captures</code> type represents the groups captured by a successful match and allows for easy extraction of matched substrings.</p>
<p>The regex crate supports a wide range of regular expression syntax, including Perl-style regular expressions and POSIX extended regular expressions. It also supports Unicode character properties and provides a range of Unicode-aware matchers and modifiers.</p>
<p>The regex crate is highly performant and is designed to handle large inputs efficiently. It provides a range of options for controlling the matching behavior, such as case-insensitive matching, multi-line matching, and greedy or lazy quantifiers.</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">https://crates.io/crates/serde</a></p>
<p>The Rust Serde crate is a widely used library for serialization and deserialization of Rust data structures to and from various data formats, such as JSON, TOML, YAML, and many others.</p>
<p>To use Serde, you first need to add it to your project's dependencies in your Cargo.toml file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
serde = { version = &quot;1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that your project depends on the Serde crate, and also enables the <code>derive</code> feature, which allows you to automatically derive the serialization and deserialization code for your Rust data structures.</p>
<p>Once you've added Serde to your project, you can start using it to serialize and deserialize Rust data structures. For example, you can define a Rust struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This defines a <code>Person</code> struct with two fields: <code>name</code>, which is a <code>String</code>, and <code>age</code>, which is a <code>u32</code>. The <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]</code> attribute tells Serde to automatically generate the serialization and deserialization code for this struct.</p>
<p>You can then use Serde to serialize an instance of this struct to JSON:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let person = Person { name: &quot;Alice&quot;.to_string(), age: 30 };
let json = serde_json::to_string(&amp;person).unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This creates a <code>Person</code> instance and serializes it to JSON using the <code>serde_json::to_string</code> function. The <code>&amp;person</code> argument is a reference to the <code>Person</code> instance that you want to serialize.</p>
<p>You can also deserialize a JSON string into a Person instance:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let json = r#&quot;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&quot;#;
let person: Person = serde_json::from_str(json).unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This deserializes the json string into a <code>Person</code> instance using the <code>serde_json::from_str</code> function.</p>
<p>Serde provides many other serialization and deserialization functions and features, such as support for custom serialization and deserialization logic, support for enums, and more. Its documentation provides a detailed guide on how to use it for different data formats and use cases.</p>

<p>The Rust <code>walkdir</code> crate is a library that provides a simple and efficient way to iterate over directories and their contents. It is used in Rust programs and applications that require traversing directories, such as file managers, build systems, or search engines.</p>
<p>The <code>walkdir</code> crate provides an iterator-based API that allows developers to iterate over the entries in a directory tree recursively, while providing various options for filtering out unwanted entries, such as hidden files or directories, symbolic links, or files that do not match a certain pattern.</p>
<p>The <code>walkdir</code> crate is designed to be simple and easy to use, while providing performance optimizations and safety guarantees. It is built on top of the <code>std::fs</code> module, and takes advantage of Rust's ownership and borrowing system to ensure that resources are managed correctly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Some of the key features of the <code>walkdir</code> crate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recursive directory iteration with configurable maximum depth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering options based on file attributes or name patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error handling and recovery mechanisms for I/O errors or permission issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configurable follow-symlinks behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for custom sorting and ordering of entries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional support for cross-platform path handling and case sensitivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the <code>walkdir</code> crate is a useful and reliable tool for working with directories and file systems in Rust programs. Its API is well-documented and easy to use, making it an essential part of many Rust projects.</p>
<p>Example of how to use the walkdir crate in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use walkdir::WalkDir;

fn main() {
    for entry in WalkDir::new(&quot;/path/to/directory&quot;).into_iter().filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {

            println!(&quot;File: {}&quot;, entry.path().display());
        }
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will walk through a directory at &quot;/path/to/directory&quot; and print out the name of each file or directory in it. The <code>WalkDir::new</code> function creates a new directory walker, and <code>into_iter</code> returns an iterator that can be filtered and mapped over. The <code>ok</code> method filters out any errors that may occur during iteration. We then check if each entry is a directory or a file using the <code>file_type</code> method on the <code>entry</code>. Finally, we print out the name of the entry using the <code>display</code> method.</p>

<p>The Rust Rusqlite crate is a library for working with SQLite databases. It provides a safe and convenient interface for  creating, modifying, and querying data.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to use Rusqlite to create create a table and data:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use rusqlite::{Connection, Result};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let conn = Connection::open(&quot;example.db&quot;)?;

    conn.execute(
        &quot;CREATE TABLE person (
            id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name  TEXT NOT NULL,
            age   INTEGER NOT NULL
        )&quot;,
        [],
    )?;

    conn.execute(
        &quot;INSERT INTO person (name, age)
            VALUES (?1, ?2)&quot;,
        [&quot;Alice&quot;, 30],
    )?;

    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we first import the <code>rusqlite</code> crate and the <code>Result</code> type from the standard library, which we'll use to handle errors. We then create a new database connection by calling <code>Connection::open(&quot;example.db&quot;)?</code>, which creates a new SQLite database file called <code>example.db</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>Next, we execute a SQL statement using the <code>execute()</code> method. This creates a new table called <code>person</code> with three columns: <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>age</code>. The <code>id</code> column is the primary key for the table, and the <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> columns are both required.</p>
<p>Finally, we insert a new row into the person table using the <code>execute()</code> method again. This inserts a new row with the name &quot;Alice&quot; and the age <code>30</code>.</p>
<p>Rusqlite provides many other methods for querying and modifying data in SQLite databases, including prepared statements, transactions, and more. Check out the Rusqlite documentation for more information on how to use this powerful library.</p>

<h2 id="sqlx-query-execution"><a class="header" href="#sqlx-query-execution">sqlx query execution</a></h2>
<p>The <code>sqlx</code> crate provides a range of functions and macros for executing SQL queries and processing the results. For example, the <code>query</code> macro can be used to execute a parameterized SQL query and return the results as a vector of rows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use sqlx::{postgres::PgPool, Row};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
}

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    let pool = PgPool::new(&quot;postgres://user:password@localhost/mydb&quot;).await?;
    let rows = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, Person&gt;(&quot;SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE age &gt; $1&quot;)
        .bind(18)
        .fetch_all(&amp;pool)
        .await?;

    for row in rows {
        println!(&quot;Person: {:?}&quot;, row);
    }

    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="sqlx-transactions"><a class="header" href="#sqlx-transactions">sqlx transactions</a></h2>
<p>The <code>sqlx</code> crate provides a simple and safe way to manage database transactions, using the <code>begin</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>rollback</code> functions. For example, you can use these functions to perform a database update within a transaction:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use sqlx::{postgres::PgPool, Transaction};

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    let pool = PgPool::new(&quot;postgres://user:password@localhost/mydb&quot;).await?;
    let mut tx = pool.begin().await?;

    sqlx::query(&quot;UPDATE person SET name = $1 WHERE id = $2&quot;)
        .bind(&quot;Alice&quot;)
        .bind(1)
        .execute(&amp;mut tx)
        .await?;

    tx.commit().await?;

    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>

<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use sqlx::{postgres::PgPool, Row};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    age: i32,

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    let pool = PgPool::new(&quot;postgres://user:password@localhost/mydb&quot;).await?;
    let row = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT id, name, age FROM person WHERE id = $1&quot;)
        .bind(1)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool)
        .await?;

    let person = Person {
        id: row.get(0),
        name: row.get(1),
        age: row.get(2),

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="axum-crate-for-web-services"><a class="header" href="#axum-crate-for-web-services">axum crate for web services</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/axum">https://crates.io/crates/axum</a></p>
<p>The Rust axum crate provides a fast, low-level web framework for building microservices and APIs. Axum is designed to be easy to use, performant, and composable, meaning you can mix and match components to build a custom web application that meets your needs.</p>
<p>Axum is built on top of Rust's async/await syntax and uses Tokio as its underlying async runtime. This means that Axum is well-suited for building high-performance, non-blocking web services that can handle a large number of concurrent requests.</p>
<p>Axum provides a number of features that make it a powerful tool for building web applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Routing: Axum makes it easy to define routes for your web application, allowing you to map URLs to specific functions or handlers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middleware: Axum supports middleware, which are functions that can be run before or after a request is processed. Middleware can be used for things like logging, authentication, and authorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error handling: Axum provides a flexible error handling system that allows you to handle errors in a way that makes sense for your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing: Axum includes tools for testing your web application, making it easy to write automated tests for your code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Rust axum is well-suited for building microservices and APIs. If you're looking for a fast, low-level framework that gives you complete control over your web application, then Axum is definitely worth considering.</p>
<p>Here's an example of using the axum crate to build a web service in Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use axum::{handler::get, Router};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

async fn hello_world() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
    &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route(&quot;/&quot;, get(hello_world));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));

    println!(&quot;Listening on http://{}&quot;, addr);

    axum::Server::bind(&amp;addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we use the axum crate to define a simple web service that responds to HTTP GET requests to the root URL with a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message.</p>
<p>First, we define an asynchronous function called <code>hello_world</code> that returns the static string &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.</p>
<p>Next, we define a router using the <code>Router::new()</code> function, and use the <code>route()</code> method to define a route that maps the root URL (<code>&quot;/&quot;</code>) to the hello_world handler function.</p>
<p>We then create a SocketAddr object representing the address and port on which the web service will listen (<code>127.0.0.1:3000</code>), and print a message indicating that the service is listening on that address.</p>
<p>Finally, we use the <code>axum::Server</code> type to bind the address to the web service, and serve it using the <code>serve()</code> method.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hyper-crate-for-http-clientsservers"><a class="header" href="#hyper-crate-for-http-clientsservers">Hyper crate for HTTP clients/servers</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/hyper">https://crates.io/crates/hyper</a></p>
<p>The Rust Hyper crate is a popular library for writing HTTP clients and servers in the Rust programming language. It provides a high-level and efficient API for handling HTTP requests and responses, as well as low-level control over the details of the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>With the Hyper crate, developers can easily build custom HTTP clients and servers, handle HTTP authentication, manage cookies, and perform SSL/TLS encryption. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous programming styles, and is compatible with Rust's built-in async/await syntax.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of using the Hyper crate is its performance. It's built using Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions, which makes it fast and efficient. Additionally, the Hyper crate is designed to be modular and extensible, which makes it easy to add custom functionality and plugins.</p>
<p>TODO: example</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tokio-crate-for-asynchronicityconcurrency"><a class="header" href="#tokio-crate-for-asynchronicityconcurrency">Tokio crate for asynchronicity/concurrency</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">https://crates.io/crates/tokio</a></p>
<p>The Rust Tokio crate is a widely used library for building asynchronous and concurrent applications. It provides a runtime for executing asynchronous tasks and a set of libraries for building networking and other I/O-heavy applications.</p>
<p>First add it to your project's dependencies in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<p>Once you've added Tokio to your project, you can start using it to build asynchronous and concurrent applications. For example, you can define a Tokio task that performs an asynchronous computation:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use tokio::task;

async fn compute() -&gt; u32 {
    // Perform an expensive computation asynchronously
    42
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let result = task::spawn(compute()).await.unwrap();
    println!(&quot;Result: {}&quot;, result);
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This defines an <code>async</code> function called compute that performs an expensive computation asynchronously and returns a <code>u32</code>. The <code>#[tokio::main]</code> attribute tells Tokio to use its runtime to execute the main function, and the <code>task::spawn</code> function spawns a new task to execute the compute function asynchronously.</p>
<p>In summary, the Tokio crate is a powerful library for building asynchronous and concurrent applications in Rust. It provides a runtime for executing asynchronous tasks and a set of libraries for building networking and other I/O-heavy applications. Its documentation provides a detailed guide on how to use it for different use cases and scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="tokio-for-network-applications"><a class="header" href="#tokio-for-network-applications">Tokio for network applications</a></h2>
<p>You can also use Tokio to build network applications, such as a simple HTTP server:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use tokio::net::TcpListener;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];
            let n = socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await.unwrap();
            let request = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;buf[..n]);
            println!(&quot;Received request:\n{}&quot;, request);

            let response = &quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, World!&quot;;
            socket.write_all(response.as_bytes()).await.unwrap();
        });
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This defines a main function that binds to port 8080 and listens for incoming TCP connections. When a connection is accepted, a new task is spawned to handle the request asynchronously. The task reads the incoming data from the socket, prints it to the console, and sends a response back to the client.</p>
