# Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Hash traits for comparisons

In Rust, traits are used to define shared behavior for types. The following are commonly used traits for comparing and hashing types in Rust:

* Eq trait: This trait is used to define the equality relation between two values of a given type. The Eq trait requires that the type implements the PartialEq trait, which defines the partial equality relation. If two values of a type are equal according to the Eq trait, they must be considered indistinguishable in every way.

* PartialEq trait: This trait is used to define the partial equality relation between two values of a given type. The PartialEq trait requires that the type implements an eq method that takes another value of the same type as an argument, and returns a bool indicating whether the two values are equal. If two values of a type are equal according to the PartialEq trait, they must be considered indistinguishable for the purposes of the Eq trait as well.

* Ord trait: This trait is used to define the total order relation between two values of a given type. The Ord trait requires that the type implements the PartialOrd trait, which defines the partial order relation. If two values of a type are compared using the Ord trait, they must be completely ordered in a consistent way.

* PartialOrd trait: This trait is used to define the partial order relation between two values of a given type. The PartialOrd trait requires that the type implements a partial_cmp method that takes another value of the same type as an argument, and returns an Option<Ordering> indicating the ordering relationship between the two values. If two values of a type are compared using the PartialOrd trait, they must be partially ordered in a consistent way.

* Hash trait: This trait is used to define the hash value of a value of a given type. The Hash trait requires that the type implements a hash method that returns a hash value of type u64. Hash values should be consistent and uniform, so that two values that are equal according to the Eq trait produce the same hash value.

These traits are important for comparing and hashing types in Rust, and are used extensively in Rust's standard library.
